`subak-gui.exe` is a small native window that shows the Host's **Terminals as tabs** and the
shown tab's pane live. It is a client of the per-user Host, like `subak attach`: the Terminals
and their programs live in the Host, so closing the window, hiding a tab — or the window
crashing — never ends them. The Host and the `subak` CLI work without it. The optional floating
icon, tray icon and Terminal manager (`subak-gui --float`, Step 18) are §11; search,
selection, the clipboard, links and saving output (Step 19) are §12; settings, themes, fonts,
motion, shell profiles and the polish of Step 20 are §13.

## 1. Starting it

```text
subak-gui [<terminal>] [--endpoint <name>] [--no-hotkeys]
subak-gui --float [--icon] [--tray] [--manager] [--endpoint <name>] [--no-hotkeys]   (§11)
subak-gui --manager [--endpoint <name>]                                               (§11)
subak-gui --help | --version
```

| Situation | What the window does |
| --- | --- |
| Always | Every Terminal of the Host is a tab (§2), in the Host's order. |
| `<terminal>` given (a name, case ignored, or a `t-` id) | Shows its tab. If it does not exist or does not run, says so in a banner and shows the first running tab. |
| No `<terminal>`, the Terminal shown last still runs | Shows it (remembered by id, then by name, in `gui.json`). |
| Otherwise | Shows the first running tab (Step 16's chooser is replaced by the tabs). |
| None exists | "No Terminal is open in this window": `Ctrl+T` (or `+`) starts one; the next Terminal any client creates (`subak new`) opens by itself. |
| No Host runs | Starts one, as the CLI does (same start lock), **without a shell**: opening the window never starts a shell of its own. |
| The endpoint is held by something that is not a Subak Host of this user, or no Host can start | An error screen with the stable code (`host_identity_mismatch`, `spawn_failed`, …), the message and `Enter` to retry. Nothing was sent to the impostor. |

Opening the window never creates, stops, kills or removes a Terminal. Only the explicit actions
of §2 do: `Ctrl+T` creates one, `Ctrl+W` ends or removes the shown one.

`subak-gui.exe` must sit next to `subak.exe` (it starts that program on demand). `--endpoint`
selects a private Host endpoint, as `subak --endpoint` does. `--no-hotkeys` (or `KIM_NO_HOTKEYS`)
starts the window with every shortcut off (§3).

## 2. Tabs, closing, crashing, reconnecting

**The tab bar** (32 px, DESIGN_SYSTEM §3.5) lists the Host's Terminals — running, starting,
stopping, stopped and failed ones — in the Host's order (creation order), except the ones hidden
in this window. Each tab shows its state as a shape (`●` running, `◐` starting or stopping, `■`
stopped, `▲` failed, `○` gone or unknown while disconnected), its name (cut with `…`) and a `×`.
The shown tab is bold, filled like the pane below it and marked with a lilac line on top (reverse
video in High Contrast). `+` after the last tab creates a Terminal; `‹`/`›` appear when the tabs
do not fit (the shown tab always stays visible). Only the shown tab's pane is attached: switching
detaches the old pane and attaches the new one, whose screen and history come back from the
Host; a program that asked for focus reports is told it lost the focus first.

**Other clients.** A Terminal created elsewhere (`subak new`) appears as a new tab at once but
does not take over the window (keys never move to a Terminal you did not choose). Renames,
stops and kills by any client update the tabs at once; a killed or exited shown Terminal keeps
its last screen with a banner (Enter closes the tab).

| Action | Keys and mouse | What it does to the Terminal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Next / previous tab** | `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` (wrapping), a click on a tab | Nothing: a detach of the old pane, an attach of the new one |
| **New Terminal** | `Ctrl+T`, `+`, the tab menu | Creates one with the Host's defaults (your default shell in your profile folder) at the window's size and shows it |
| **Rename** | `Ctrl+Shift+R`, a double click on the tab, the tab menu | The name becomes an edit field (Enter saves by id, Esc cancels; Korean through the IME works); a name in use or invalid is refused by the Host and the field stays with the reason |
| **Hide tab** (view dismissal) | The tab's `×`, a middle click, the tab menu, `tab.hide` (no default key) | **Nothing**: a detach of this window. The Terminal keeps running, `subak ls` lists it, and the tab menu's "Show hidden: …" brings it back. Hiding lasts while this window runs. |
| **Close Terminal** (end a live Terminal) | `Ctrl+W`, the tab menu | `terminal.kill` of the shown Terminal by its id. An idle shell ends at once. When the Host reports it **busy** (it runs more than an idle shell, e.g. a Claude session), the window asks: "End `x`? It runs … (n processes in its job); they will be ended. [ Cancel (Esc) ] End Terminal" — **Cancel is the default**: `Esc`, Enter on Cancel or a click on it ends nothing; `Tab`/arrows move to "End Terminal", Enter or a click ends exactly that Terminal. The question goes away if the Terminal ends or another tab is shown. Keys typed meanwhile reach no program. |
| **Remove a stored Terminal** | `Ctrl+W` on a stopped or failed tab, "Remove Terminal" in the tab menu | `terminal.remove` without force: deletes the Host's record; nothing runs in it, so it does not ask. Restarting a stopped Terminal is Step 30. |
| **Move a tab** | The tab menu, `tab.move-left`/`tab.move-right` (no default keys) | Nothing: the order is this window's |
| **Tab menu** | A right click on a tab or the bar, the context-menu key (`Menu`; over the pane its menu starts with the pane's items, §12.6) | A native menu with the actions above and "Show hidden: …" |

The window's close button stays a detach of everything (below). A setting that makes `Ctrl+W`
only hide the tab (ADR 0009) is `subak hotkeys set tab.hide Ctrl+W --replace`.

| Event | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Close button, Alt+F4, the window menu's Close | A **detach**: every Terminal keeps running (`subak ls`). |
| The window's process ends (crash, Task Manager) | The Host drops the connection; nothing else changes. |
| Another client detaches the window (`subak detach <terminal>`) | The last screen stays, with a banner "Detached by cli client (pid …); `x` keeps running. Enter: reattach". |
| The program exits, or the Terminal is stopped or removed by another client | The last screen stays, with a banner saying what happened and the exit code; `Enter` closes the tab of a Terminal that is gone (a stopped one stays: `Ctrl+W` removes it). |
| The Host goes away (stopped, crashed) | The last screen stays, with a banner "Disconnected: …. Reconnecting to `x` (attempt n)…"; the tabs show `○`. The window retries after 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 s, then every 10 s, and **never starts a Host while reconnecting**. When a Host serves the endpoint again it reattaches the same Terminal by id if it runs, else shows the first running tab and says the old one is gone. `Enter` retries at once. |

A Host stops its Terminals' programs when it ends (ADR 0003), so a reconnect after a Host crash
finds new Terminals at most; restoring them is Steps 29–31.

**Internal windows and panes (Step 21, [ADR 0054](adr/0054-subak-internal-windows-and-panes.md)).**
A tab is a Terminal, never an internal window. When a Terminal has several internal windows or
panes (`subak window new`, `subak pane new`), its tab shows the **active window's active pane** —
the Host's selection, the same for every client — and the title names it, e.g. `work [window
1:logs pane 1 (2 windows, 3 panes)] — Subak`. When the selection changes (`subak window select`,
`subak pane select`, another client, or the shown pane's program ending while others run), the
window detaches that pane and attaches the newly active one; nothing ends, and closing the window
still only detaches every pane. This is deliberately minimal: there are no keys or menu items to
switch windows or panes yet (the `Ctrl+B` prefix table, Step 23), no split view (Step 22), and the
tab bar does not list windows (a status line, Step 25).

## 3. Keyboard, IME and mouse

Keys go to the program, in the order of ADR 0009:

1. **IME guard.** While an input method composes (Korean, Japanese, Chinese), keys belong to it.
   The composition is drawn inline at the cursor (underlined, on `bg.overlay`), the candidate
   list opens below the cursor, and only committed text is sent.
2. **The window's own fields.** While the busy confirmation (§2) is open, its keys answer it and
   every other key is swallowed; while a tab is renamed, the field takes the keys. Nothing
   reaches the program and no shortcut fires.
3. *(The `Ctrl+B` prefix table is Step 23. Until then `Ctrl+B` goes to the program.)*
4. **The shortcuts** — Subak's actions of the [hotkey contract](HOTKEY_CONTRACT.md) (§13.1): the
   manifest shipped as `hotkeys.manifest.json`, layered with `%APPDATA%\mouv\subak\hotkeys.json`
   (`subak hotkeys …`, [SUBAK_CLI §3.12](SUBAK_CLI.md)). The window re-reads the file when it gets
   the focus; a broken or newer file means the defaults (safe mode) and a banner; `--no-hotkeys`
   and `KIM_NO_HOTKEYS` turn every shortcut off. Sequences (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+N`), physical `code:`
   and `char:` keys and the `release`/`hold` triggers work as the contract says; a pending
   sequence shows a banner and `Esc`, a click or focus loss cancels it. A shortcut's key never
   reaches the program, not even its auto-repeat (unless the binding has `repeat: true`).

   | Action id | Default keys | Scope | What |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | `terminal.new` | `Ctrl+T` | app | New Terminal (§2) |
   | `terminal.close` | `Ctrl+W` | app | Close Terminal: ends the shown one, asks when busy; removes a stored one (§2) |
   | `tab.next` / `tab.previous` | `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | app | Next / previous tab |
   | `terminal.rename` | `Ctrl+Shift+R` (`Ctrl+B $` with Step 23) | app | Rename the shown Terminal |
   | `tab.hide`, `tab.move-left`, `tab.move-right` | none | app | Hide the shown tab; move it |

   `Ctrl+T` and `Ctrl+W` are keys programs use too (readline's transpose and delete-word): the
   contract reports them as `shadows_terminal_input`. Until the `Ctrl+B` pass-through of
   Step 23, a program gets them once you disable or rebind the action
   (`subak hotkeys disable terminal.close`). The Step 16 keys below are actions of the
   `terminal` context and are rebindable the same way:

   | Action id | Keys | What |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `clipboard.copy` | `Ctrl+Shift+C`, `Ctrl+Insert` | Copy the selection (plain text, CR LF line ends) |
   | `clipboard.paste` | `Ctrl+Shift+V`, `Shift+Insert` | Paste plain text: line breaks become Enter, control characters are removed, bracketed when the program asked (`SUBAK-SEC-013`); asks first when lines would run, control characters hide in it, or it is large (§12.2) |
   | `clipboard.copy-html`, `clipboard.paste-one-line` | none (the pane menu) | Copy with colours (plain text and HTML Format); paste as one line (§12.2–12.3) |
   | `selection.all` / `selection.mark` | `Ctrl+Shift+A` / `Ctrl+Shift+M` | Select all; select with the keyboard (mark mode, §12.3) |
   | `search.open` | `Ctrl+Shift+F` | Find in the output (§12.1) |
   | `output.save` | none (the pane menu) | Save the output to a file, asking first (§12.5) |
   | `view.zoom-in` / `view.zoom-out` / `view.zoom-reset` | `Ctrl+Plus` / `Ctrl+Minus` / `Ctrl+0` (and the numpad `+`, `-`, `0`) | Text size 8–36 px (default 13), saved as `appearance.font_size` in `config.toml` (§13) |
   | `scroll.page-up` / `scroll.page-down` | `Ctrl+Shift+PageUp` / `PageDown` | Scroll the history a page |
   | `scroll.line-up` / `scroll.line-down` | `Ctrl+Shift+Up` / `Down` | Scroll a line |
   | `scroll.top` / `scroll.bottom` | `Ctrl+Shift+Home` / `End` | Oldest line / live screen |

5. **Everything else** goes to the program in the xterm encoding (TERMINAL_EMULATOR §4.1):
   characters as UTF-8 (Alt adds `ESC`; AltGr characters are text), `Ctrl+letter` as C0 controls,
   `Ctrl+Space` as NUL, `Ctrl+2`…`Ctrl+8` as the VT220 codes, cursor keys (`SS3` in application
   cursor mode), Home/End/Insert/Delete/PageUp/PageDown and F1–F12 with modifiers, `Shift+Tab`
   as `CSI Z`. `Ctrl+C` interrupts the program; it is never "copy". Alt+F4 closes the window and
   Alt+Space opens its window menu, as in every Windows program; a lone Alt or F10 does not open
   a menu bar. Typing returns a scrolled-back view to the live screen.

The **mouse**: drag selects (double click: word, triple click: line, Alt+drag: block); a single
click clears the selection; right click copies a selection, or pastes when there is none;
`Ctrl+click` opens a link and `Ctrl+right click` opens the pane menu (§12.4, §12.6); the
wheel scrolls the history 3 lines per notch (or goes to the program when it tracks the mouse, or
sends cursor keys on the alternate screen when the program asked for alternate scroll); Shift
always selects, as in xterm. On the tab bar: a click shows a tab, a double click renames it, a
middle click or its `×` hides it, a right click opens its menu, `+` creates a Terminal.

**Focus**: the cursor is a filled block (or the program's shape) with focus and a hollow box
without it; programs that asked for focus reports (mode 1004) get them. The cursor does not
blink (no idle timer; DESIGN_SYSTEM §4.5).

## 4. Window, DPI and states

- A normal resizable window with minimize and maximize, the native caption in dark mode (on
  Windows 11 also the caption, text and border colours of the tokens), the terminal surface in
  `terminal.background` with 8 px padding, the area around the cell grid in the same colour.
  Title: the program's title and the Terminal name, "`title` — `name` — Subak".
- **Per-monitor DPI v2.** Moving to a monitor with another scale re-rasterizes the glyphs at the
  new size (never a bitmap scale), takes the size Windows suggests, and the pane follows the new
  grid. The smallest window holds 20 × 5 cells.
- **Resizing** sends the new grid to the Host (one size per pane, the latest interactive client's,
  ADR 0008); a resize to the pane's current size changes nothing. **Minimizing** never resizes the
  pane.
- **High Contrast**: with Windows High Contrast on (and `appearance.theme` `auto` or `system`,
  §13), the terminal and the
  screens use the system's window, text and highlight colours and no lilac; the shown tab and the
  focused confirmation button are in reverse video. It follows changes while the window is open.
- **States are never blank and never colour-only** (DESIGN_SYSTEM §3.8): connecting ("Connecting
  to the Subak Host…" and the endpoint), opening, empty, a stored Terminal ("`x` is stopped …
  `Ctrl+W` removes it", naming the keys as bound), the error screen (code, message, hint, "Press
  Enter to try again"), the banners of §2 (a one-line strip in the status colour at 12 % over
  `bg.raised`, a 3 px marker, words that say what happened and what `Enter` does), and the busy
  confirmation (danger colour, the focused button filled and in brackets).

## 5. Placement: `%APPDATA%\mouv\subak\gui.json`

The window's own file, independent of the Host's state (no process ids, no terminal content, no
secrets): where the window was and which tabs it showed. Schema (version 2, Step 20):
[subak-gui-v2](contracts/schemas/subak-gui-v2.schema.json), examples in
`contracts/examples/subak-gui-v2/`. The settings — theme, text size and everything else of §13
— are in `config.toml`.

```json
{
  "schema": "subak.gui",
  "schema_version": 2,
  "window": { "x": 240, "y": 120, "width": 1452, "height": 912, "dpi": 144, "maximized": false },
  "last_terminal": { "id": "t-3f2a9c41d07e", "name": "빌드" },
  "hidden_terminals": []
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `window` | The restored (not maximized) outer rectangle in physical pixels at `dpi`, and `maximized`. Used only if a title bar's worth of it lies on a current monitor; its size is rescaled to that monitor's DPI. |
| `last_terminal` | The Terminal shown last; reopened when it still runs |
| `hidden_terminals` | Terminals hidden in the window when it last ran, by id (Step 18). A new window keeps them hidden; they keep running, the tab menu's "Show hidden: …" and the Terminal manager (§11) show them again |

- Written **atomically** (a temporary file, flushed, renamed) and only on a change: a move or
  resize that ended, maximize/restore, a zoom, another Terminal, closing. Never while idle.
- Unknown keys are kept when the file is rewritten (`SUBAK-FR-046`).
- An invalid value falls back to its default alone; the window says so once in a banner.
- A file that is not JSON, not a `subak.gui` document, or from a newer schema version is used as
  defaults and **never rewritten** by this run; the banner says so.
- **Version 1** (Steps 16–19, [subak-gui-v1](contracts/schemas/subak-gui-v1.schema.json)) also
  held `font_size` and `theme`. The first Step 20 window migrates it once: the two values go into
  `config.toml` where that file does not set them yet, the old file is copied to
  `backups\gui-v1-<UTC time>.json`, and `gui.json` is rewritten as version 2 (unknown keys kept).
  When `config.toml` cannot take them (invalid or newer), version 1 is left as it is and its
  values apply to that window only.

## 6. How it works

| Part | Where | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model | `crates/subak/src/gui/model.rs` | The Host conversation as a state machine without I/O: the tabs and which one to attach, create/kill/remove/rename by id, the busy answer, other clients' changes, phases, snapshots and resyncs, the pane's end, reconnects with backoff |
| Screens | `gui/screens.rs` | VT text of the state screens, banners and the busy confirmation in the design tokens, and their High Contrast form |
| Tabs | `gui/tabs.rs` | The tab bar: tab widths, scrolling, states as shapes, the rename field, clickable spans |
| Layout | `gui/layout.rs` | DPI scale, grid ↔ client area, saved placements on monitors |
| Keys | `gui/keys.rs` | The shortcuts: Subak's manifest and `hotkeys.json` through `kim-hotkeys` (`crate::hotkeys`), logical/physical/character keys, sequences and triggers; key and character mapping |
| Preferences | `gui/prefs.rs` | `gui.json` |
| Composition | `gui/compose.rs` | The client area from its layers (also what test shots and goldens use) |
| Network | `gui/net.rs` | A reader thread (connect or start, identity checks, frames in) and a writer thread (frames out) |
| Window | `gui/window.rs` | Win32: paint (tab bar strip, pane, banner, IME), keyboard dispatch, the confirmation and the rename field, the native tab menu, mouse, clipboard, DPI, High Contrast, test hooks |
| Binary | `crates/subak/src/bin/subak-gui.rs` | GUI subsystem (no console window) |
| Floating UI | `gui/float/*.rs` | `--float` (§11): placement, the icon's picture, the manager's model, `float.json`, the tray trait (portable, unit-tested) and the Win32 icon, tray and manager (`float/win.rs`) |
| Search, questions, clipboard, export | `gui/find.rs`, `gui/ask.rs`, `gui/clip.rs`, `gui/export.rs` | Step 19 (§12.6): the search bar, the paste/link/export questions, the clipboard, opener and save picker as traits with recording fakes, "Save output…" |

Data path: the reader queues frames and posts one message per batch; the window feeds them to the
pane's `TermView` (the same model as the Host), renders only changed rows, and invalidates only
those. A snapshot at attach (or after a resync) starts a fresh view at the snapshot's size; once
complete, the view follows the window's grid. The interactive view answers the program's device
reports. Synchronized output (mode 2026) holds the frame until the program ends its update, at
most 150 ms.

Safety: the window is an IPC client of kind `gui` with the CLI's identity checks (same user,
`subak.exe`, before anything is sent); it ends a Terminal only on `Ctrl+W` or the menu, by id and
with `force` only after the user's answer, never starts a shell by opening, never touches another
user's Host, opens a link only on the user's `Ctrl+click` after validation (`http`/`https`, through
the OS "open" verb, §12.4), never honours OSC 52, never writes the system clipboard except for an
explicit copy, and writes output to a file only on "Save output…" after a question (§12.5).

## 7. Measurements

This machine: Windows 10 Pro 22H2 19045, Intel Core i5-13600KF, 2026-11-04.

| What | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Idle, release build (`--features test-hooks` for the off-screen flag), attached to a live cmd.exe Terminal, 30 s, no output (`step16_idle.ps1`, the Step 15 sampler's quantities) | Step 16: **0.0 ms CPU, 3.95 MiB private, 11.3 MiB working set, 5 threads, 154 handles**. Step 17, three tabs (one attached), the same sampler (`step17_idle.ps1`, `Process.TotalProcessorTime` over 30 s): **0 ms CPU, 4.34 MiB private, 11.5 MiB working set, 5 threads, 150 handles** |
| Idle, debug build, same, 10 s (`tests/gui_window.rs::idle_window_costs_no_cpu_and_little_memory`) | Step 16: 0.0 ms CPU, 4.06 MiB private, 12.6 MiB working set, 6 threads, 153 handles. **Step 17 (with the tab bar): 0.0 ms CPU, 4.38 MiB private, 13.5 MiB working set, 6 threads, 157 handles** |
| Step 15 references (ADR 0036) | renderer + GDI window, no IPC: 3.40 MiB private, 1 thread; egui + glow: 107.0 MiB private, 12 threads |
| Binary sizes (release, shipped features) | Step 16: `subak-gui.exe` 917 KB; `subak.exe` 1.57 MB. Step 17 (the hotkey contract's checker and editor in both, `subak hotkeys` in `subak.exe`): `subak-gui.exe` 1.31 MB; `subak.exe` 2.10 MB |
| `subak.exe` carries no window or renderer | its import table names none of `CreateDIBSection`, `GetFontData`, `SetDIBitsToDevice`, `CreateWindowExW`, `ImmGetContext`, `gdi32` (checked with `grep -c -a` on the release binary); `subak-gui.exe` names all of them |

The threads beyond Step 15's one: the reader and writer (blocked in the kernel when idle), and
the system's input-method threads.

## 8. Known limits (Steps 16–17)

- One window per process. Hidden tabs are kept across runs (`gui.json`, Step 18; with several
  windows the one closed last decides); the tab order is the window's own and not saved.
- No `Ctrl+B` prefix or pass-through (Step 23): a program gets `Ctrl+T`/`Ctrl+W` only once the
  action is disabled or rebound. `AltGr` and `Win` chords are not matched by the window.
- A background tab is not attached: its activity and Claude state are not shown (Steps 26–28).
- Search, the paste question, link opening and copy-as-HTML arrived in Step 19 (§12, with its
  own limits in §12.11).
- win32-input-mode is not granted: Ctrl+Break and key releases do not reach programs.
- UI text uses the terminal font; the tab bar is in the client area (the integrated title-bar tab
  bar of DESIGN_SYSTEM §3.5 needs custom non-client drawing). Settings, themes, hover and the
  window icon arrived in Step 20 (§13, with its own limits in §13.10); there are no tooltips on
  tabs.
- No UI Automation tree yet (screen readers do not read the terminal); planned with Step 20/39.
- Colour emoji are monochrome; the cursor does not blink.
- The banner covers the pane's first row while it is shown.

## 9. Manual verification (maintainer)

Agents on this machine never show windows or synthesize input, so these checks are the
maintainer's. Build first: `cargo build --release -p subak` (both binaries land in
`target\release`). Use a private endpoint so nothing touches your own Host:
`set E=--endpoint subak-manual-16`.

1. `target\release\subak.exe %E% new work` — then `target\release\subak-gui.exe %E% work`. A
   window opens with the cmd.exe prompt; the title reads "… — work — Subak"; the caption is dark.
2. Type `dir`, `echo 한글 테스트`, `ver`. Output appears at once; Korean sits in two cells per
   syllable without overlap.
3. Switch the input method to Korean (한/영) and type `echo 한글`: while composing, the syllable is
   drawn underlined at the cursor; nothing reaches cmd.exe until the syllable is committed;
   Hanja conversion (한자 key) opens its list below the cursor. Shortcuts (`Ctrl+Shift+C`) do not
   fire during composition.
4. Keys: `↑` recalls the last command; `Ctrl+C` interrupts `ping -t localhost`; `Esc`, `Tab`
   completion, `F7` (cmd history list), `Ctrl+Plus`/`Ctrl+Minus`/`Ctrl+0` change the text size;
   `Alt+F4` closes (then reopen with step 1's second command).
5. Mouse: drag selects, double click a word, triple click a line; right click copies; right
   click again pastes; `Ctrl+Shift+V` pastes; the wheel scrolls back, typing returns to the live
   screen.
6. Focus: click another window — the cursor becomes a hollow box; click back — filled.
7. Maximize, restore, minimize, restore: the content re-lays out each time; `subak.exe %E% info
   work` shows the pane size following the window (and unchanged while minimized).
8. DPI: move the window to a monitor with another scale (or change the scale in Settings →
   Display → Scale): text re-renders sharp at the new size, without blur or a flash of a wrong
   size.
9. High Contrast: turn on a Contrast theme (Settings → Accessibility → Contrast themes): the window
   switches to the system colours; turn it off: kim-dark returns.
10. Close the window with the X button: `subak.exe %E% ls` still lists `work` as running with the
    same pid. Reopen with `subak-gui.exe %E%` (no name): it reopens `work`, at the same size and
    position, with the earlier output.
11. End `subak-gui.exe` in Task Manager: `subak.exe %E% ls` still shows `work` running.
12. With the window open, run `subak.exe %E% detach work`: a banner says it was detached; `Enter`
    reattaches. Run `subak.exe %E% host stop --kill-terminals --yes`: the banner says
    "Disconnected …"; run `subak.exe %E% new other`: within 10 s the window lists `other`.
13. Clean up: `subak.exe %E% host stop --kill-terminals --yes`.
14. Record the Windows build, scale(s), keyboard layout and pass/fail per step in the Step 16
    issue.

**Tabs (Step 17).** With the same `%E%`:

15. `subak.exe %E% new one`, `subak.exe %E% new two`, then `subak-gui.exe %E%`: two tabs; `one` is
    shown, bold, with a lilac line on top joined to the pane.
16. From a console: `subak.exe %E% new three` — a third tab appears, `one` stays shown;
    `subak.exe %E% rename two 둘` — the tab reads `둘`; `subak.exe %E% kill three --yes` — the tab
    goes.
17. Press `Ctrl+Tab`, `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` (also hold `Ctrl+Tab`: it switches once, nothing reaches
    the shell): the tabs switch; typed text goes to the shown tab only.
18. `Ctrl+T`: a new tab running cmd.exe; `Ctrl+W` on it closes it without a question.
19. `subak.exe %E% new busy -- ping -n 1000 127.0.0.1`, show it, `Ctrl+W`: the question names
    `PING.EXE`; Enter (Cancel is focused) keeps it; `Ctrl+W`, `Tab`, Enter ends it; `one` still
    runs.
20. `Ctrl+Shift+R`, type `작업` with the Korean IME (composition drawn in the tab), Enter:
    `subak.exe %E% ls` shows the new name. Double click a tab: the same field.
21. Click a tab's `×`: the tab goes, `subak.exe %E% ls` still shows it running; right click the bar
    → "Show hidden: …" brings it back. Press the `Menu` key: the shown tab's menu opens under it.
22. `subak.exe %E% hotkeys disable terminal.close`, click into the window: `Ctrl+W` now deletes a
    word in PowerShell (`subak.exe %E% new ps -- powershell`); `subak.exe %E% hotkeys reset
    terminal.close`, click again: `Ctrl+W` closes again.
23. Turn on a Contrast theme: the shown tab is in reverse video, states keep their shapes.
24. Close the window with X: `subak.exe %E% ls` lists every Terminal running. Clean up as in 13.

## 10. Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/subak/tests/gui_window.rs` (Windows; the debug build's off-screen window driven by its own messages) | attach to a CLI-created Terminal: same pane pid, no second cmd.exe, one pane, a `gui` client, typed and Korean input reaching the shell (window and `subak capture`); close (WM_CLOSE) and crash (TerminateProcess) leave the Host and the pane with the same pids, a new window reopens the remembered Terminal with its screen; `subak detach` → banner → Enter reattaches; a stopped Host → disconnected banner, no Host started while retrying, a returning Host reconnected; empty, two-tab and error (a pipe squatter) screens; paste, copy, wheel, cursor keys, IME composition and commit, focus; synthetic DPI 192/96, resize, minimize, zoom, `gui.json` persistence and its error rules; frames of the window's own content (`SUBAK_GUI_SHOTS=<dir>` keeps them as BMP); idle CPU and memory |
| `crates/subak/tests/gui_window.rs` Step 17 tests (a stand-in program, this test binary run in a pane, plays the busy Claude session; never Claude Code) | `tabs_follow_the_headless_cli_and_ctrl_tab_switches_without_ending_anything` (CLI new/rename/stop/kill follow; `Ctrl+Tab`/`Ctrl+Shift+Tab` move the attachment; input to the shown tab only; `Ctrl+W` on a stored tab removes only the record); `ctrl_t_creates_and_ctrl_w_closes_asking_first_when_busy_never_hitting_another_terminal` (window-size create, idle shells closed at once, repeated create/close, the question for the busy stand-in: Esc, Enter on Cancel and a click on Cancel end nothing, keys typed meanwhile never reach it, consent ends only its id); `the_window_x_and_a_tab_x_only_detach_and_hidden_tabs_come_back` (a click on `×`, a middle click and `WM_CLOSE` are detaches, the Menu key's menu, "Show hidden"); `rename_in_place_and_keys_for_the_program_reach_it_once_a_shortcut_is_off` (Korean rename, `name_conflict` keeps the field, a disabled `Ctrl+T` reaches the program as 0x14 after a focus reload, `Ctrl+Tab` never does); `shortcuts_off_safe_mode_and_focus_transitions` (a broken `hotkeys.json`, a sequence cancelled by focus loss, input following the shown tab, `--no-hotkeys`) |
| `crates/subak/src/gui/*.rs` unit tests | the model (no, one and many Terminals as tabs, cycling, a late attach answer, create, `Ctrl+W` by id with the busy answer and consent, hiding and unhiding, stored removal, other clients' create/rename/stop/kill, attach decisions, snapshots, resyncs, ends, backoff), the key matcher (the requested keys with exact modifiers, Step 16 keys, keys for programs, auto-repeat, rebinding and disabling, sequences, `code:`/`char:` keys, release and hold, side-specific modifiers, safe mode and reload, `--no-hotkeys`), the tab bar (no/one/many tabs, scrolling with the shown tab visible, the rename field), screens, banners and the confirmation (words, actions, the safe default, High Contrast, tokens = `design/tokens.json`), layout with synthetic DPI 96–288 and monitor layouts, character mapping, preferences, golden frames |
| `crates/subak/tests/golden/gui_*.txt` | golden frames (built-in rasterizer) of the connecting, empty, stored-Terminal and error screens at 100 % and 200 %, the tab bar at 100 % and 200 %, the banner over a pane, the inline IME composition; `SUBAK_BLESS=1` refreshes them |
| `e2e/tests/step16_subak_window.rs` (ignored; `cargo xtask e2e` only) | the release window against a release Host: attach without a new shell, input, close and crash keep the pane, reconnect |
| `e2e/tests/step17_subak_tabs.rs` (ignored; `cargo xtask e2e` only) | tabs following CLI new/rename/kill, `Ctrl+Tab` switching with input to the shown tab only; `Ctrl+T`, `Ctrl+W` asking before ending a busy Terminal (Esc keeps it, consent ends only it), the window X only detaching |
| Step 18 | the floating icon and Terminal manager: §11.10 |
| Step 19 | search, selection, the clipboard, links and saving output: §12.10 |
| `gui_window.rs::the_window_follows_internal_windows_and_panes_and_closing_ends_none` and the model test `the_window_follows_the_hosts_window_and_pane_selection` (Step 21) | the off-screen window shows the active pane of a Terminal with 2 windows and 3 panes, names it in the title, follows window and pane selections made by the CLI (detach and attach only), types into the shown pane only, follows a pane exit to the next active pane; closing the window keeps all 3 pane processes |
| `crates/subak/src/gui/keystate.rs` unit test (Step 21) | the off-screen test window and floating UI read **no real key state**: a Shift, Ctrl or Alt held on the machine (by the user, or by another test's synthesized input) cannot turn a test's Menu key into `Ctrl+Menu`, as it did once in Step 20's merge gate. A real window still reads `GetKeyState` as before; under the test mode modifiers come only from what the test sends (the `key` command, `MK_SHIFT`/`MK_CONTROL` of a mouse message, the Alt context bit of a posted `WM_SYSKEYDOWN`/`WM_SYSCHAR`). Checked with modifiers set in the test thread's own key table (`SetKeyboardState`, which synthesizes no input) |

## 11. The floating icon, tray icon and Terminal manager (Step 18)

`subak-gui --float` runs a small, optional companion to the windows: a **floating icon** that
stays above other windows, and/or a **tray icon**, and the **Terminal manager** they open. It is
a tiny process of the same binary on the same plain Win32 stack (ADR 0045): no GUI framework, no
terminal renderer, no GPU. It is a client of the Host like a window; it never attaches a pane,
and closing it — or the manager — ends nothing.

### 11.1 Starting and stopping it

```text
subak-gui --float                 the saved choice (first time: the floating icon)
subak-gui --float --tray          only a tray icon (saved)
subak-gui --float --icon --tray   both (saved)
subak-gui --manager               open the Terminal manager (starting the floating UI if needed)
```

- **Off unless you start it.** The Host and the `subak` CLI never start it and never need it;
  opening a window does not start it. Besides the command line, a window's tab menu has
  "Floating icon and Terminal manager". Nothing is added to sign-in (Run or Startup) by this
  Step.
- **One per endpoint** (and Windows session): running `subak-gui --float` or `--manager` again
  asks the running one to show itself (or its manager) and exits. `--endpoint` works as for the
  window.
- **Quit** from the icon's menu ("Quit (Terminals keep running)"), or turn off both the floating
  icon and the tray icon. A quit, a crash or ending the process in Task Manager is a disconnect:
  no Terminal, window or Host is touched.
- **Headless means none of it**: without a desktop session nothing of this runs; the CLI and the
  Host behave exactly as before (`KIM-FR-012`).

### 11.2 The floating icon

| Behaviour | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Size and look | 40 × 40 logical pixels at its monitor's DPI (60 px at 150 %, 80 px at 200 %), radius 10 on `bg.overlay`, a 1 px `border.subtle` edge, the watermelon glyph (§11.3) and a 10 px state badge |
| Never takes the focus | A tool window (no taskbar button, not in Alt+Tab) that never activates: clicking it does not move the keyboard away from the program you type into |
| Click | Opens the Terminal manager beside it (§11.4); a second click closes it |
| Drag | Moves it; it snaps to a work area's edges within 8 logical pixels and always stays fully inside a work area (never under the taskbar). The place is saved when you let go |
| Right click (press and hold on touch) | Its menu: Terminals…, Open Subak window, New Terminal, Always on top ✓, Show floating icon ✓, Show tray icon ✓, Quit (Terminals keep running) |
| Pin (Always on top) | On by default; unchecked, the icon and the manager are normal windows in the z-order |
| Hide | "Show floating icon" off hides it (the tray icon brings it back); with neither on, the floating UI quits |
| Monitors | Its place is restored on the monitor it was on, at that monitor's DPI. If that monitor is gone — or a display change (resolution, monitor unplugged, taskbar moved) leaves the icon off every work area — it comes back onto the nearest monitor; the saved place is kept for when that monitor returns |
| DPI | Per-monitor DPI v2: moving to a monitor with another scale redraws it at the new size |
| Hover | Without a Host, hovering retries the connection at once (otherwise every 0.5 s … 10 s) |
| Assistive technology | Its window name is its state in words ("Subak — 3 Terminals, 2 running"), the same as the tray tip |

### 11.3 The picture and its state (Step 44 interface)

The icon is a pure function of a small state (`gui::float::art::IconState`): whether a Host is
reachable, how many Terminals it has, how many run or failed, and the aggregate Claude indicator
(priority `need-input` > `error` > `done` > `in-progress` > `unknown` > `idle` > `none`,
`SUBAK-FR-051`; always `none` until the Host reports Claude states, Steps 26–28). It is drawn
once per state change; nothing animates and no timer runs, so a hidden icon costs nothing. The
glyph is Subak's identity drawn procedurally — a watermelon slice with a charcoal rind (with a
light edge so it never reads black-on-black), a pale band and red flesh with dark seeds — and is
**provisional**: Step 44 owns the final art and the per-state motion behind the same interface.
The badge is a shape, never colour alone: a hollow ring (no Host), a ring with a gap
(connecting), a triangle (a Terminal failed), Claude shapes later; nothing when all is well.
Under High Contrast the glyph is an outline in the system's text colour.

### 11.4 The Terminal manager

A compact popup (380 × 440 logical pixels) beside the icon — above it when the icon is in the
lower half of its work area, below otherwise, aligned to the side with room — or near the tray
icon. It lists **every Terminal of the Host**, including ones no window shows (a hidden tab, no
window at all), in the Host's order:

`● build    running · cmd.exe · shown in 1 window` · `● agent    running · busy: claude.exe (3 processes)` · `■ old    stopped`

The state is a shape and a word (`●` running, `◐` starting or stopping, `■` stopped, `▲`
failed). The header says the totals ("3 Terminals · 2 running · 1 stopped"); the status line
shows the keys as bound, or what just happened.

| Action | Keys (context `manager`, rebindable with `subak hotkeys`) | Mouse and touch | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Search | type in the field; `Ctrl+F` or `/` focuses it; typing in the list goes there too | the field | Filters by name (case and composed/decomposed Hangul folded), program, state or id prefix; `Esc` clears it |
| Move | `Up`/`Down`/`PageUp`/`PageDown` (also from the field), `Home`/`End` in the list | click a row | The selection |
| Open | `Enter` | double click, "Open" | Shows the Terminal: a window of this Host shows its tab (a hidden tab comes back) and comes to the front; with no window, a new `subak-gui <id>` opens. The manager closes unless pinned |
| New Terminal | `Ctrl+N` | "New Terminal" | Creates one with the Host's defaults and opens it. Without a Host, it starts one first — the only thing that starts a Host here |
| Rename | `F2` | "Rename" | The row's name becomes an edit field (the IME works): `Enter` saves by id, `Esc` cancels; a name in use or invalid keeps the field with the reason |
| Delete | `Delete` (in the list) | "Delete…" | **Always asks first**, naming what ends: "End `x`? It runs PING.EXE (2 processes); they will be ended." / "End `x`? Its shell (cmd.exe) will be closed." / "Remove `x`? Nothing runs in it; its record is deleted." **Cancel is focused**: `Esc`, `Enter` on Cancel or a click on it ends nothing; `Tab`/arrows move to "End Terminal" (or "Remove"). Consent sends exactly one request for exactly that Terminal, by id: `terminal.kill` (with `force` only when the question said it is busy; one that turned busy since is refused by the Host and asked again) or `terminal.remove`. While the question is open, other keys reach nothing |
| Pin | `Ctrl+P` | "Pin" | Keeps the manager open when it loses the focus (saved); unpinned it closes like a flyout |
| Close | `Esc` (with an empty search) | `×`, click the icon again | Closes the manager; an open question counts as Cancel. Nothing else changes |
| Row menu | `Shift+F10`, the Menu key | right click | Open, Rename…, Delete…, New Terminal |

`Tab`/`Shift+Tab` move between the search field, the list and the buttons; `Enter`/`Space`
press a focused button. The search field gets its editing keys first (`Delete`, `Backspace`,
arrows, `Home`/`End`, `Ctrl+A/C/V/X/Y/Z`, characters).

**States are never blank** (DESIGN_SYSTEM §3.8): "Connecting to the Subak Host…"; "The Subak Host
is not running (…). New Terminal (Ctrl+N) starts it with a Terminal."; "Cannot reach the Subak
Host: … (code). It is retried in a moment." (an impostor on the endpoint, for example); "No
Terminals yet. New Terminal (Ctrl+N) creates one."; "No Terminal matches “x”."

**Accessibility.** The manager is built from the system's own controls, so keyboard focus, the
IME, touch (mouse promotion) and the accessibility tree come from Windows: an editable text named
"Search", a list named "Terminals" whose items are the rows in words, push buttons named "New
Terminal", "Open", "Rename", "Delete…", "Pin (keep open: off)", "Close manager", and while asking
the question as text with "Cancel" and "End Terminal". Focus is a 2 px `focus.ring`; the search
field has a `border.strong` boundary; High Contrast uses the system colours.

### 11.5 Opening a Terminal, and the focus rules

- The floating icon never takes the focus. The manager takes it only when you opened it (a
  click on the icon or the tray, the tray's keyboard selection, `subak-gui --manager`), which
  Windows allows the process that received that input.
- **Opening hands the foreground on explicitly**: the floating UI asks the windows of its Host,
  front to back, whether they serve it, calls `AllowSetForegroundWindow` for that window's
  process, and asks it to show the Terminal; the window shows the tab and calls
  `SetForegroundWindow` for itself (restoring itself if minimized). With no window, it starts
  `subak-gui <id>` and allows that process. Nothing else steals the focus.
- These window-to-window requests (`WM_COPYDATA`) can only show or select — never create, end or
  change a Terminal; a window answers only for its own endpoint, and requests over 4 KiB are
  ignored. Windows' UIPI keeps lower-integrity processes from sending them.

### 11.6 Settings: `%APPDATA%\mouv\subak\float.json`

Schema: [subak-float-v1](contracts/schemas/subak-float-v1.schema.json), examples in
`contracts/examples/subak-float-v1/`.

```json
{ "schema": "subak.float", "schema_version": 1, "icon": true, "tray": false, "on_top": true,
  "manager_pinned": false, "position": { "x": 2856, "y": 1316, "dpi": 144 } }
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `icon`, `tray` | Which presences show (default: the floating icon only) |
| `on_top` | Pinned above other windows (default on) |
| `manager_pinned` | The manager stays open when it loses the focus (default off) |
| `position` | The icon's top-left corner in physical pixels and its monitor's DPI; restored as §11.2 says |

Its own file (the windows rewrite `gui.json` from memory; two processes sharing one file would
lose each other's changes). Same rules as `gui.json` (§5): written atomically and only on a
change, unknown keys kept, an invalid value falls back alone, a broken or newer file is used as
defaults and never rewritten.

### 11.7 How it works

| Part | Where | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Placement | `gui/float/place.rs` | Icon size at a DPI, the default place, drag with snapping, settling on a monitor, recovery from a lost monitor, the manager's rectangle (synthetic DPI and monitor layouts in its tests) |
| Picture | `gui/float/art.rs` | The icon from `IconState` (premultiplied BGRA, 4 × 4 supersampled), the badge, the words, Claude aggregation |
| Manager model | `gui/float/list.rs` | The Host conversation (subscribe, list, follow events, create, rename, kill, remove by id), search, selection by id, the delete question, no-Host and retry |
| Settings | `gui/float/fprefs.rs` | `float.json` |
| Tray | `gui/float/tray.rs` | The `Tray` trait and the recording `FakeTray` |
| Win32 | `gui/float/win.rs` | The layered icon window (`UpdateLayeredWindow`), `Shell_NotifyIconW`, the manager of system controls (owner-drawn list box and buttons, an edit field), keyboard dispatch before `TranslateMessage`, opening Terminals in windows, single instance, test hooks |
| Window side | `gui/window.rs`, `gui/model.rs` | Answers `probe`/`open` requests (shows the tab, comes forward), keeps hidden tabs in `gui.json` |

One connection (`subak-float`, kind `gui`) through the window's network threads; idle, both wait
in the kernel. The only timer is the reconnect delay while no Host is reachable.

### 11.8 Measurements

This machine: Windows 10 Pro 22H2 19045, 2026-11-04.

| What | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Idle, debug build, off-screen, connected to a Host with 3 Terminals, 10 s (`tests/gui_float.rs`) | icon only: **0.0 ms CPU, 1.97 MiB private, 11.0 MiB working set, 6 threads, 136 handles**; icon and manager open: 0.0 ms CPU, 1.96 MiB private, 11.0 MiB working set, 6 threads |
| Idle, **release build** (`--features test-hooks` for the off-screen mode), 30 s each, `Process.TotalProcessorTime` (`step18_idle.ps1`, the Step 16–17 quantities) | icon only, connected to a Host with 3 Terminals: **0.0 ms CPU, 1.54 MiB private, 7.33 MiB working set, 3 threads, 126 handles**; icon and manager open: 0.0 ms CPU, 1.82 MiB private, 8.89 MiB working set, 4 threads, 133 handles; no Host (retrying every 10 s): 0.0 ms CPU, 1.27 MiB private, 6.71 MiB working set, 1 thread, 116 handles. (0.0 ms: below the counter's 15.6 ms tick over 30 s) |
| Binary sizes (release, shipped features) | `subak-gui.exe` 1.31 MB (Step 17) → **1.75 MB** (icon, tray, manager, the manager's hotkey context); `subak.exe` 2.10 MB, unchanged, and its import table still names no window function (`Shell_NotifyIconW`, `UpdateLayeredWindow`, `CreateWindowExW`: 0 matches with `grep -c -a`; 1 each in `subak-gui.exe`) |
| 30 quick open/close cycles of the manager | GDI objects 4 → 4, USER objects 5 → 5 (nothing leaks) |

### 11.9 Manual verification (maintainer)

Agents on this machine never show windows, put icons into the notification area or synthesize
input, so these checks are the maintainer's. Build: `cargo build --release -p subak`; use a
private endpoint: `set E=--endpoint subak-manual-18`.

1. `target\release\subak-gui.exe %E% --float`: a 40 px watermelon icon appears at the bottom
   right of the primary monitor, above other windows, with a hollow-ring badge; no taskbar
   button; the program you were typing in keeps the focus. `subak.exe %E% ls` says no Host runs.
2. Click the icon: the manager opens above it with "The Subak Host is not running …". Press
   `Ctrl+N`: a Host starts, a Terminal is created and a Subak window opens with it, in the
   foreground; the manager closes.
3. `subak.exe %E% new work`, `subak.exe %E% new 빌드`: the icon's tooltip/name says
   "3 Terminals, 3 running" within a moment (hover the icon).
4. Click the icon, type `빌` (Korean IME): only `빌드` remains; `Esc` clears; `Down`, `Enter`:
   the existing window shows `빌드`'s tab and comes to the front.
5. In the window hide `work` (its `×`), then in the manager choose `work`, `Enter`: the tab is
   back. Close the window, reopen `subak-gui.exe %E%`: hidden tabs stay hidden.
6. In the manager: `F2` on `빌드`, type `작업`, `Enter`: `subak.exe %E% ls` shows it.
7. `subak.exe %E% new busy -- ping -n 1000 127.0.0.1`; in the manager select it, `Delete`: the
   question names `PING.EXE` with Cancel focused; `Enter` keeps it; `Delete`, `Tab`, `Enter`
   ends it and nothing else.
8. Drag the icon near a screen edge: it snaps; release it, quit from its menu, start it again:
   it is where you left it. Drag it to another monitor (with another scale): it is 40 logical px
   there. Unplug (or disable) that monitor: the icon comes back onto the remaining one.
9. Right click → "Always on top" off: other windows can cover it. "Show tray icon" on: a tray
   icon with the same tip; click it: the manager opens near it; `Win+B`, arrows, `Enter` on it:
   the manager opens with the keyboard. "Show floating icon" off: only the tray remains.
10. Narrator (`Ctrl+Win+Enter`) on the manager: it reads "Search, edit", "Terminals, list", each
    row in words, the buttons by name, and the delete question.
11. Turn on a Contrast theme: the icon is an outline, the manager uses system colours.
12. Quit from the menu: every Terminal still runs (`subak.exe %E% ls`). Clean up:
    `subak.exe %E% host stop --kill-terminals --yes`.

| `crates/subak/tests/gui_float.rs` (Windows; the off-screen floating UI driven by its own window messages, real Hosts on private endpoints) | `the_icon_starts_only_on_request_shows_no_host_and_follows_the_cli_without_starting_one` (tool window that never activates, no Host started, the no-Host manager, hover retry, CLI changes followed, quit ends nothing); `the_manager_searches_opens_renames_and_deletes_by_id_asking_first` (accessible names, search, typing from the list, open in a new then an existing window with the foreground request, rename in Korean, the guarded delete for busy and idle Terminals, keys during a question reach nothing); `new_terminal_from_the_manager_starts_a_host_on_demand_and_opens_it`; `drag_snaps_and_saves_and_display_and_dpi_changes_keep_the_icon_on_a_monitor` (posted mouse messages, snapping, saved place across runs, a synthetic two-monitor layout, `WM_DISPLAYCHANGE` after a monitor goes, DPI 192, the manager inside the work area, an on-screen layout refused); `repeated_quick_open_close_leaks_nothing_and_the_idle_icon_and_manager_cost_no_cpu`; `the_tray_is_a_fake_in_tests_and_the_menu_switches_pin_and_presence_and_quits_ending_nothing`; `a_second_start_forwards_to_the_running_one_and_neither_cli_nor_host_starts_it`; `hidden_tabs_persist_across_runs_and_the_manager_shows_a_hidden_terminal_in_its_window`; `a_window_menu_starts_the_floating_ui_for_its_endpoint_once` (the tab menu entry; a second request only shows the running one) |
| `crates/subak/src/gui/float/*.rs` unit tests | placement with synthetic DPI and monitor layouts (default place, snapping, clamping, recovery, the manager's rectangle), the picture (tile, glyph, badges per state, every size, High Contrast), Claude aggregation, the manager model (no Host and retries, New Terminal starting a Host, events from other clients, search with Hangul folding, selection, rename by id, the delete question and its answers), `float.json` and its schema, the fake tray, `--test-monitors` |
| `e2e/tests/step18_floating_manager.rs` (ignored; `cargo xtask e2e` only) | the floating manager following a Host it did not start, search, open, `Ctrl+N`, rename, the guarded delete; drag, saved place, a monitor going away |

### 11.11 Known limits (Step 18)

- The watermelon glyph is provisional (Step 44 owns the art and the Claude motion); there is no
  Claude state yet (Steps 26–28), so the badge shows Host and failure states only.
- No hover tooltip window on the floating icon (its accessible name and the tray tip carry the
  words); no `gui.show` global hotkey (`subak-gui --manager` with a link's shortcut key instead);
  no sign-in start.
- The manager has no "Stop" (a stopped Terminal cannot be restarted before Step 30) and no
  multi-select.
- Opening a Terminal picks the frontmost window of the Host; choosing a particular window is
  Step 21's.
- The manager uses Segoe UI through GDI; the list box's scroll bar is the classic one.

## 12. Search, selection, the clipboard, links and saving output (Step 19)

Decision: [ADR 0048](adr/0048-subak-search-clipboard-and-links.md) · Requirements:
`SUBAK-FR-047`, `SUBAK-SEC-013`, `SUBAK-SEC-014`, `SUBAK-FR-034`, `KIM-SEC-013`

Everything here works on what the window's view of the pane holds — the same bounded model the
Host keeps ([SCROLLBACK §1](SCROLLBACK.md)): the screen and the retained history (2 000 rows /
4 MiB by default, `subak new --history-limit` up to 100 000 rows), including output printed while
no window was attached, which the attach snapshot brings back. Nothing is loaded into GPU memory
(the renderer draws on the CPU), nothing is copied beside the model except the matches, and no
output is ever sent anywhere. Only `cli` and `gui` clients receive history at all
([IPC_PROTOCOL §4](contracts/IPC_PROTOCOL.md)).

### 12.1 Search

`Ctrl+Shift+F` (`search.open`, or "Find…" in the pane menu) opens the search bar in the row over
the top of the pane (where banners appear; a match is never revealed under it):

`  Find  marker-2▏             3 of 111   Aa case (Alt+C)  .* regex (Alt+R)  ab word (Alt+W)   Enter older · Shift+Enter newer · Esc close`

| Keys | What |
| --- | --- |
| Characters, `Ctrl+V`, the paste keys | Type or paste into the field (one line). Every change searches again at once (incremental). A one-line selection is the query when the bar opens. |
| `Enter`, `F3`, `Up` | The next **older** match (wrapping to the newest) |
| `Shift+Enter`, `Shift+F3`, `Down` | The next **newer** match (wrapping to the oldest) |
| `Alt+C` / `Alt+R` / `Alt+W` (or a click on the option) | Case-sensitive / regular expression / whole word; an option that is on shows `✓` (not colour alone) |
| `Backspace`, `Delete`, `Ctrl+Backspace` (word), `Left`, `Right`, `Home`, `End` | Edit the field |
| `Esc` | Close the bar: the highlights go, the current match stays selected (copy it with `Ctrl+Shift+C`) |
| Shortcut chords (`Ctrl+Tab`, `Ctrl+Shift+C`, scrolling …) | Still work; other keys reach nothing while the bar is open (nothing is typed into the program) |

- **Where it starts.** Matches are counted oldest first; the search starts at the newest match at
  or above the last visible row, so it finds what you just saw first. The current match is
  selected and drawn dark on `terminal.search-current`; the others are tinted
  `terminal.search-match` (DESIGN_SYSTEM §2.2); High Contrast uses the system highlight and
  reverse video. The bar says "3 of 111" in words.
- **What is searched.** Plain text, logical line by logical line: rows joined across soft wraps,
  so a wrapped address or path is found whole; Korean, CJK and emoji count as their cells; a
  combining mark stays with its character. Literal text by default (case folded the Unicode
  way); with `.*` a regular expression of the `regex` crate (Unicode `\w`, `\b`, `\d`; no
  look-around or back-references). On the alternate screen (`vim`, `less`), what the program
  shows is searched; the history again once it leaves.
- **Bounded.** A pattern is at most 1 000 characters; one that compiles to more than 512 KiB or
  nests deeper than 64 is refused ("too complex") and never run; a broken one says why in the bar.
  Matching is linear in the text (no catastrophic patterns). A search stops after 10 000 matches,
  keeping the newest ("… of 10 000 (the newest; more exist)"), or after 250 ms ("newest lines;
  stopped after 250 ms"); the history itself is bounded.
- **Live.** New output while the bar is open refreshes the matches without moving the view: the
  history lines already searched are kept, only the new lines and the screen are searched again.

### 12.2 Paste

The paste keys (`Ctrl+Shift+V`, `Shift+Insert`, a right click without a selection) paste the
clipboard's **plain text** — only its Unicode text format is read; HTML, RTF, files and images
are never interpreted, and a clipboard without text says "The clipboard holds no text to paste".
Line breaks become Enter, control characters are removed, and the text is bracketed when the
program asked for it (`SUBAK-SEC-013`). The window **asks first** (`SUBAK-SEC-014`) when the paste

- has line breaks and the program did not ask for bracketed paste — they would run as commands
  at once ("Paste 2 lines that run at once? First line: `rm -rf build`");
- carries control characters, which are removed whatever you answer and often hide an escape
  sequence that disguises a command ("Paste 1 hidden control character (an escape sequence;
  removed)? …"); asked even under bracketed paste;
- is larger than 5 KiB.

`[ Cancel (Esc) ]  As one line   Paste` — **Cancel is focused**: `Esc`, `Enter` on Cancel or a
click on it pastes nothing; `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`/arrows move; `Enter`/`Space` answer. "As one line"
(also the action `clipboard.paste-one-line`, "Paste as one line" in the pane menu) trims the
surrounding blanks and turns every line break into one space, so nothing runs before you press
Enter. Keys typed while it asks reach nothing.

### 12.3 Selection and copy

- **Mouse**: drag (double click: word, triple click: line, `Alt`: block; `Shift` always selects,
  as in xterm), a right click copies a selection — as before (§3).
- **Keyboard (mark mode)**: `Ctrl+Shift+M` (`selection.mark`) puts a one-cell caret at the cursor
  (or keeps the current selection). Arrows move it; `Shift`+arrows grow the selection; `Ctrl` moves
  by words (a growing selection ends with the word); `Home`/`End` the line, `PageUp`/`PageDown` a
  page, `Ctrl+Home`/`Ctrl+End` the oldest line / the end; the view scrolls along. `Enter` copies
  and leaves, `Esc` leaves, a typed character leaves and goes to the program. Outside mark mode
  `Shift`+arrows stay the program's (PSReadLine selects with them).
- `Ctrl+Shift+A` (`selection.all`) selects the history and the screen.
- **Copy** (`Ctrl+Shift+C`, `Ctrl+Insert`): plain text, a wide character once, trailing blanks
  removed, soft-wrapped rows joined, CR LF line ends. **Copy with colours** (`clipboard.copy-html`,
  no default key; "Copy with colours (HTML)" in the pane menu) also puts `HTML Format` on the
  clipboard: a `<pre>` in the terminal font with the theme's colours, bold, italic and
  decorations, for editors and mail. A copy clears the selection.

### 12.4 Links

| What | How it opens |
| --- | --- |
| A web address in the text (`http://`, `https://`; the sentence's trailing `.`/`,` and an unbalanced `)` are not part of it; found across soft wraps) | `Ctrl+click` opens it at once: its text is its target |
| An OSC 8 hyperlink (dotted underline; its text may differ from its target) | `Ctrl+click` shows the target first: "Open https://… with your default browser? `[ Cancel (Esc) ]  Copy link  Open`" |
| A refused target | "Not opened: `file:` links are not opened (only http and https). Link: …" with "Copy link" |

- **Validation** (`subak_term::links`): `http` and `https` only; no user name or password
  (`https://bank.example@evil.example` is refused), no blanks, control characters or `\` in the
  host part, a host, at most 2 048 characters. The scheme and host are lower-cased and non-ASCII
  characters of the path are percent-encoded; that exact text is shown and opened.
- **Opening** hands the target to Windows' "open" handler for it (`ShellExecuteW` with the verb
  `open` — your default browser), never through a shell command line. Terminal output never opens
  anything by itself.
- In a program that tracks the mouse, `Ctrl+click` is the program's; `Ctrl+Shift+click` is the
  window's (as `Shift` always is).
- `Ctrl+right click` opens the pane menu with "Open link …" and "Copy link" for the link under
  the pointer.

### 12.5 Saving output

"Save output…" (`output.save`, no default key; the pane menu) saves what the view holds — the
history and the screen as logical lines, UTF-8 with CR LF — only after a question that says what
Subak's secret detector (the rules of `subak capture`, [SCROLLBACK §6](SCROLLBACK.md)) found:

`Save 2 341 lines (118 KB) of `work` to a file? 3 secret-looking values found: hide them as *** or save exactly.  [ Cancel (Esc) ]  Save with them hidden…  Save exactly…`

With nothing found it still warns that the check is heuristic ("it may still hold private data")
and offers `Save…`. Cancel is focused. After the choice the Windows save dialog asks where
(suggesting `<terminal>-output-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.txt`, UTC); the file is written through a
temporary file and a rename, and only there. Cancelling the dialog saves nothing.

### 12.6 The pane menu and how it works

The **Menu key** (`ContextMenu`) over the pane, and `Ctrl+right click`, open the pane menu: the
link under the pointer (for `Ctrl+right click`), Copy, Copy with colours, Paste, Paste as one line,
Select all, Select with the keyboard, Find…, Save output…, then the shown tab's items (§2), with
the keys as bound.

| Part | Where | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Search engine | `crates/subak-term/src/search.rs` | Query, bounded regex, newest-first scan with a match cap and a time budget, incremental refresh (headless) |
| Links | `crates/subak-term/src/links.rs` | Address detection in logical lines, target validation (headless) |
| View | `crates/subak-term/src/view.rs` | Logical lines, highlights, reveal, span and select-all selection, mark mode, the selected cells for HTML |
| Paste check | `crates/subak-term/src/input.rs` (`PasteCheck`, `one_line`) | What a paste would do (headless) |
| HTML | `crates/subak-term/src/render/html.rs` | The coloured fragment and the CF_HTML document |
| Search bar | `crates/subak/src/gui/find.rs` | The field, options, the current match, the bar's row |
| Questions | `gui/ask.rs` | Paste, link and export questions, Cancel first |
| Outside world | `gui/clip.rs` | `Clipboard`, `Opener` and the save picker as traits, with recording fakes |
| Export | `gui/export.rs` | The output, the secret detector, the file name, the atomic write |
| Window | `gui/window.rs` | Keys and mouse, the banner row, the pane menu, the Win32 clipboard (`CF_UNICODETEXT`, `HTML Format`), `ShellExecuteW`, `GetSaveFileNameW` |

The Host and the CLI never call any of it (`crates/subak/tests/search_boundary.rs`); the Host's
model gained only two read accessors. The off-screen test window uses the recording fakes: the
system clipboard, a browser and the dialog are never touched by a test.

### 12.7 Measurements

This machine: Windows 10 Pro 22H2 19045, Intel Core i5-13600KF, 2026-11-04.

| What | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Debug window, off-screen, real Host: 15 000 rows printed by cmd.exe (`gui_window.rs::a_large_history_stays_responsive_while_it_is_searched`) | printed in 2.0 s; typing a 9-character query (9 incremental searches) 207 ms; the last search 15 006 lines in **19.7 ms**; a regex with 1 500 matches 36 ms; a dump round trip afterwards 0.6 ms |
| Headless, the largest history by bytes: 60 000 coloured lines fed, 37 108 rows / 4 MiB kept (`subak-term/tests/search.rs::huge_history_search_numbers`) | debug: literal (37 matches) 87 ms, regex (8 571 matches) 132 ms, the default budget stopping at 10 000 matches 25 ms |
| Same, release build (`cargo test --release -p subak-term --test search huge -- --nocapture`) | literal (37 matches) over 37 138 rows in **3.9 ms**; regex (8 571 matches) **9.6 ms**; the default budget stopping at 10 000 matches 2.1 ms; the backtracking traps 0.07–0.2 ms each |
| Backtracking traps (`(a*)*b`, `(a\|aa)+$`, `(a\|a?)+b`, `^(a+)+c$`) over 200 lines of 199 `a` | 0.8–1.5 ms each (debug), no match lost |
| Binary sizes (release, shipped features) | `subak-gui.exe` 1.75 MB (Step 18) → **2.97 MB** (2 974 720 bytes: mostly the `regex` engine and its Unicode tables; a leaner feature set without the one-pass and backtracking engines saved only 86 KB and was slower, so Ddalgak's set is kept); `subak.exe` **unchanged**, 2 100 224 bytes |
| `subak.exe` carries none of it | `grep -c -a` on the release binaries: `ShellExecuteW`, `GetSaveFileNameW`, `RegisterClipboardFormatW`, `regex parse error` (the regex engine's message) and `StartFragment` (the CF_HTML builder) — 0 in `subak.exe`, ≥ 1 in `subak-gui.exe` |
| Idle | unchanged: no timer or thread was added; the bar, highlights and questions cost nothing while nothing happens |

### 12.8 Keyboard help (every key of the window)

| Keys | Action (id) | Context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+T` / `Ctrl+W` | New Terminal (`terminal.new`) / Close Terminal, asks when busy (`terminal.close`) | app |
| `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Next / previous tab (`tab.next`, `tab.previous`) | app |
| `Ctrl+Shift+R` | Rename the Terminal (`terminal.rename`) | app |
| — | Hide tab, move tab left/right (`tab.hide`, `tab.move-left`, `tab.move-right`) | app |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C`, `Ctrl+Insert` | Copy (`clipboard.copy`) | terminal |
| — | Copy with colours (`clipboard.copy-html`) | terminal |
| `Ctrl+Shift+V`, `Shift+Insert` | Paste, asks first when needed (`clipboard.paste`) | terminal |
| — | Paste as one line (`clipboard.paste-one-line`) | terminal |
| `Ctrl+Shift+A` | Select all (`selection.all`) | terminal |
| `Ctrl+Shift+M` | Select with the keyboard (`selection.mark`) | terminal |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F` | Find (`search.open`) | terminal |
| — | Save output (`output.save`) | terminal |
| `Ctrl+Plus` / `Ctrl+Minus` / `Ctrl+0` | Text size (`view.zoom-*`) | terminal |
| `Ctrl+Shift+PageUp`/`PageDown`/`Up`/`Down`/`Home`/`End` | Scroll (`scroll.*`) | terminal |
| `Menu`, `Ctrl+right click` | The pane menu (§12.6) | reserved navigation |
| In the search bar | `Enter`/`F3`/`Up` older · `Shift+Enter`/`Shift+F3`/`Down` newer · `Alt+C`/`Alt+R`/`Alt+W` options · `Esc` close | the field |
| In mark mode | arrows, `Shift`, `Ctrl`, `Home`/`End`, `PageUp`/`PageDown`, `Ctrl+Home`/`End` · `Enter` copy · `Esc` leave | mark mode |
| In a question | `Tab`/arrows move · `Enter`/`Space` answer · `Esc` cancel (the default) | the question |
| `Ctrl+click` | Open a link (§12.4) | mouse |

Every shortcut (not the field, mark-mode and question keys, which are reserved navigation like
the rename field's) can be changed or turned off with `subak hotkeys` (`hotkeys.json`); `subak
hotkeys list` prints the current keys. `Ctrl+Shift+A/F/M` are free in
cmd.exe and PowerShell; disable an action to give its key to a program that needs it.

### 12.9 Manual verification (maintainer)

Agents on this machine never show windows, use the real clipboard or open a browser, so these
checks are the maintainer's. Build: `cargo build --release -p subak`; use a private endpoint:
`set E=--endpoint subak-manual-19`.

1. `target\release\subak.exe %E% new work`, then in a console
   `target\release\subak.exe %E% attach work` and run
   `for /l %i in (1,1,3000) do @echo line %i 한글 marker-%i`; detach (`Ctrl+B d`).
2. `target\release\subak-gui.exe %E% work`: the window opens with the output. Press
   `Ctrl+Shift+F`, type `marker-29`: "11 of 11" at once, the newest match selected and the others
   tinted; `Enter` walks older, `Shift+Enter` newer, wrapping; the bar's row never hides the
   current match.
3. Type the Korean `한글` with the IME (the composition is drawn in the field): matches appear;
   `Alt+R`, then `marker-1\d\d$`: 100 matches; type `(`: the bar says the pattern is not valid.
   `Esc`: the bar closes, the match stays selected; `Ctrl+Shift+C`, paste into Notepad: the text.
4. `Esc`, then in the window run
   `for /l %i in (1,1,5) do @(echo late %i & ping -n 2 127.0.0.1 >nul)`, press `Ctrl+Shift+F` at
   once and type `late`: the count grows while the program prints, the view stays put.
5. Copy two lines from Notepad (`echo one` / `echo two`), `Ctrl+Shift+V` in the window: the
   question names 2 lines, Cancel is focused; `Enter` pastes nothing; again, `Shift+Tab`,
   `Enter`: both run. Again, `Tab` ("As one line"), `Enter`: one line waits at the prompt.
6. In a browser, copy text that contains hidden formatting (or use
   `powershell -c "Set-Clipboard ('echo hi' + [char]27 + '[2J')"`), `Ctrl+Shift+V`: the question
   names a hidden control character; pasting shows `echo hi[2J` without the escape.
7. `Ctrl+Shift+M`, arrows, `Shift+Right`, `Ctrl+Shift+Right`, `Shift+End`, `Enter`: the selection
   follows the keys over Korean text by whole characters; Notepad receives it. `Ctrl+Shift+A`,
   `Ctrl+Shift+C`: the whole history.
8. Select colored output (`dir` in PowerShell 7, or `git log --color` if installed), the Menu key →
   "Copy with colours (HTML)", paste into Word or Outlook: colours and the terminal font.
9. `echo see https://example.com/path, then`: `Ctrl+click` the address: the default browser opens
   `https://example.com/path` (no comma). `echo https://u:p@example.com/`: `Ctrl+click` refuses
   it with the reason; "Copy link" copies it. `Ctrl+right click` on an address: the menu offers it.
10. Print a fake token (`echo GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123`), the Menu key →
    "Save output…": the question counts the secret-looking values; `Tab`, `Enter`: the save dialog
    suggests `work-output-….txt`; save; open the file: `GITHUB_TOKEN=***`. Repeat with
    "Save exactly…": the token is in the file. Cancel the dialog: nothing is saved.
11. Turn on a Contrast theme: matches use the system highlight, the current one reverse video.
12. Clean up: `subak.exe %E% host stop --kill-terminals --yes`.

| Manual check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Search in the visible window, the IME in the field, live refresh (steps 1–4) | automated off-screen (§12.10; IME not); visible run **pending — maintainer** |
| Paste questions with the real clipboard and real browser/Notepad content (steps 5–6) | automated with the fake clipboard; real clipboard **pending — maintainer** |
| Mark mode and select all with the real keyboard, copy into Notepad (step 7) | automated off-screen with window messages; real keyboard and clipboard **pending — maintainer** |
| HTML Format in Word/Outlook (step 8) | the CF_HTML document is checked byte by byte (offsets) in unit tests; a real paste **pending — maintainer** |
| A real browser opened by `Ctrl+click` (step 9) | the fake opener records verb `open` and the exact target; real browser **pending — maintainer** |
| The real save dialog and file (step 10) | the fake picker and the real file write are automated; the dialog **pending — maintainer** |
| High Contrast (step 11) | **pending — maintainer** |

### 12.10 Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/subak-term/tests/search.rs` | Korean, wide characters and combining marks mapped to cells; case, whole word and regex options; Unicode classes and case folding; regex limits (empty, too long, invalid, compiled size, nesting) and linear time on backtracking traps; matches across soft wraps; history retention, eviction, `ESC[3J` and an incremental refresh equal to a full search; the alternate screen alone; the match cap keeping the newest and the time budget; starting points; highlights per row and reveal below the first row; mark mode (cells, wide characters, words, lines, pages, scrolling, typing leaves); select all; hyperlinks and detected addresses; paste checks and `one_line`; huge-history numbers |
| `crates/subak-term/tests/render.rs::search_highlights_and_the_current_match` | the match tint, the current match over the selection, only the rows involved redrawn |
| `crates/subak-term/src/links.rs`, `render/html.rs` unit tests | address detection and validation (schemes, credentials, backslashes, blanks, escapes, length); HTML runs, escaping, Korean, CF_HTML byte offsets |
| `crates/subak/src/gui/{find,ask,clip,export}.rs` unit tests | the bar (incremental, older/newer with wrap-around, editing, options, errors, live refresh keeping the current match, the row and the caret); the questions (words, answers, Cancel first, focus moves, spans); the fake clipboard's formats and plain-text-only reads, the fake opener's verb; the export (logical lines, the detector, a private key block, names, the atomic write) |
| `crates/subak/tests/gui_window.rs` Step 19 tests (off-screen window, real Hosts, recording fakes) | `search_finds_output_printed_while_no_window_was_attached_and_follows_new_output`; `paste_asks_before_lines_that_run_or_hidden_control_sequences_and_reads_only_text` (exact bytes received by a stand-in program); `copy_formats_keyboard_selection_select_all_and_the_pane_menu`; `ctrl_click_opens_only_validated_web_addresses_with_the_open_verb`; `save_output_asks_naming_the_secrets_found_and_writes_only_the_chosen_file`; `a_large_history_stays_responsive_while_it_is_searched`; and Step 16's paste test answering the question |
| `crates/subak/tests/search_boundary.rs` | the Host, the CLI and the terminal model never reach the window's search, clipboard, link or export code |
| `e2e/tests/step19_search_clipboard.rs` (ignored; `cargo xtask e2e` only) | a later window searches output the Host kept; paste asks first, copy with colours, `Ctrl+click` through the open verb, a refused credential link, an export with secrets hidden |

### 12.11 Known limits (Step 19)

- Search is the window's; `subak capture --history` piped to `findstr` remains the CLI's way, and
  tmux's copy-mode search is Step 24's.
- Composed and decomposed forms are different text (`é` vs `e` + U+0301); `\p{Hangul}` and other
  script classes are not compiled in.
- A wide character pushed to the next row by a soft wrap leaves a blank at the row's end that
  a search across that wrap sees as a space.
- No setting to turn the paste question off (`SUBAK-SEC-014`), no file-path links, no files
  dropped from Explorer, no "search the web for the selection" (it would send output to a web
  service; not planned). Copy on select, the right/middle click actions and word separators
  arrived with the settings of Step 20 (§13).
- Opening a link needs the mouse (`Ctrl+click`, `Ctrl+right click`); there is no keyboard link
  picker yet (a keyboard user can select an address in mark mode and copy it).
- The search bar and questions use the terminal font and the banner row (Step 20 keeps it so:
  the integrated search field of DESIGN_SYSTEM §3.8 is a tracked deviation, §13.10).

## 13. Settings, themes, fonts, motion and shell profiles (Step 20)

Decision: [ADR 0051](adr/0051-subak-settings-profiles-and-appearance.md) · Requirements:

### 13.1 The settings file: `%APPDATA%\mouv\subak\config.toml`

One human-edited TOML file with a version. Every key is optional; a key you do not set uses
its default. Edit it by hand, with `subak config set`, or from the window's **Settings** menu
(§13.4) — all three change the same lines.

```toml

| Theme | Draws with |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` (default) | `kim-dark`; the system colours while Windows High Contrast is on |
| `system` | `kim-light` while Windows apps use the light mode, else `kim-dark`; High Contrast wins |
| `kim-dark`, `kim-light` | always that theme (DESIGN_SYSTEM §2.1–2.2; every declared contrast pair checked by `design-check`) |
| `high-contrast` | the system's window, text and highlight colours, reverse video for the shown tab and focused buttons |

**Rules** (`SUBAK-FR-046`):

- A missing file means the defaults; nothing is written by reading.
- An invalid value falls back to its default **alone**, named with its key and line ("config.toml
  line 3: `appearance.font_size` must be a number from 8 to 36 (logical pixels); the default
  (13) applies"); the window shows the first problem once in a banner, `subak config check`
  lists them all. An invalid profile is left out with its reason.
- A file that is not TOML, or whose `config_version` is newer than this Subak's, is used as
  defaults and **never rewritten by an edit** (not by the menu, `config set` or the zoom keys:
  those then last for the window's run, and a notice says so). `subak config reset --all --yes`
  replaces an invalid file after copying it to `backups\config-invalid-<UTC>.toml`; a newer file
  is never replaced.
- Edits change only their own lines: comments, unknown keys and sections stay as they are. The
  edited text is parsed again and must differ in exactly the edited keys, or nothing is written.
  Writes are atomic.
- `reset --all`, `import` and the `gui.json` migration (§5) first copy the file to `backups\`;
  the newest 5 backups of each kind are kept.
- **No secrets.** Subak never writes a secret-looking value into a profile (`import` refuses:
  `secret_in_config`). A secret-looking environment value or argument typed in by hand is used,
  reported as a warning naming the variable (never the value), and shown as `***` in the window,
  every CLI output and `subak config export`. Let programs read secrets from your own
  environment instead.

### 13.2 When settings apply — and what they never touch

- The window reads `config.toml` when it starts and **again whenever it gets the focus**; it
  applies what changed (a new theme, font or size at once; a new line height or text size
  re-lays out the grid, so the shown pane is resized to it, as a zoom does).
- **The Host never reads it** (`tests/config_boundary.rs`). A profile is resolved by the client
  into the explicit program, arguments, folder and environment of `terminal.create`; changing or
  deleting a profile never changes a Terminal that runs, and a broken file never stops the Host.
  Running Terminals keep their processes, environment and state whatever you change (checked by
  `tests/config_cli.rs` and `tests/gui_settings.rs`).

### 13.3 Shell profiles

| Where | What starts |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+T`, `+`, "New Terminal" | the default profile (`terminal.default_profile`), else the Host's default shell |
| The tab or pane menu → "New Terminal: <name>" | that profile |
| `subak new --profile <name>` | that profile; `-- <program>`, `--command-line`, `--cwd`, `--env`, `--unset-env` given there win over the profile's |
| `subak new` with no program | the default profile, unless `--no-profile` |

Profiles are local programs only (no SSH, serial or Telnet: Step 33). A profile names a program,
never a shell command line; the arguments are passed as separate words. Names ignore case. A
default profile that does not exist is a warning; new Terminals then run the Host's shell.

### 13.4 The settings menu

The tab menu (right click on the bar) and the pane menu (the Menu key, `Ctrl+right click`, or a
right click with `right_click = "menu"`) end with **Settings**:

| Item | Choices (the current one checked) |
| --- | --- |
| Theme | Automatic · Follow Windows light or dark mode · Kim dark · Kim light · High Contrast |
| Text size | Larger · Smaller · Default (also `Ctrl+Plus`/`Ctrl+Minus`/`Ctrl+0`) |
| Terminal font | Default chain · the installed ones of Cascadia Mono, Cascadia Code, Consolas, Courier New, Lucida Console, D2Coding, JetBrains Mono · "Ligatures: not drawn" (§13.10) |
| Line spacing | 1.0 · 1.2 · 1.4 · 1.6 |
| Window opacity | 100 · 95 · 90 · 80 · 70 % |
| Motion | Follow Windows · Reduced · Full |
| Copy on select · Ctrl+C copies a selection · Middle click pastes | on/off |
| Right click | Copy a selection, else paste · Open the pane menu · Paste · Nothing |
| Edit settings file (config.toml)… | opens it in Notepad (created with a header first) |
| Reload settings | reads it now |

A choice applies at once and is saved in `config.toml` (a short notice confirms it and hides
after 4 s). Before "Settings", the menu lists "New Terminal: <name>" for every profile. Windows'
menus are operated with the keyboard (Menu key, arrows, Enter, Esc) and read by screen readers.

### 13.5 The look: polish, motion, High Contrast

- **Tabs**: the shown tab is bold on `bg.base` with the lilac marker; a tab under the pointer gets
  `bg.hover` and a brighter `×`; states keep their shapes. Light and dark chrome come from the
  same tokens (the screens, banners, search bar and questions are mapped role by role).
- **Motion** (DESIGN_SYSTEM §2.5): when another tab is shown its marker fades in (120 ms); a
  banner fades in rising 4 px (160 ms); both decelerate (`easing.standard`). Nothing else moves:
  never the terminal content, the layout or typing. A 16 ms timer runs only during a transition.
  **Reduced motion** — Windows' "Show animations in Windows" off with `motion = "system"`, or
  `motion = "reduced"` — draws the final state at once, with no timer.
- **Notifications**: problems stay in the banner until a key; non-critical confirmations (a saved
  setting, a copied link, settings reloaded) are toasts that hide after 4 s.
- **Window**: Subak's watermelon (the floating icon's art) is the window's icon in the taskbar and
  Alt+Tab; the caption follows the theme (light caption for `kim-light`; colours on Windows 11).
  `opacity` below 100 makes the whole window translucent (a layered window); High Contrast is
  always opaque, and below 100 % the text's contrast depends on what lies behind the window.
- **High Contrast** (DESIGN_SYSTEM §4.3) as before (§4), now also chosen explicitly with
  `theme = "high-contrast"`.

### 13.6 How it works

| Part | Where | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settings | `crates/subak/src/config.rs` | Parse, validate (key and line), defaults, in-place edits, backups, export redaction, import checks, profiles → `terminal.create` parameters, the `gui.json` v1 adoption (portable, headless) |
| CLI | `crates/subak/src/config_cmd.rs`, `terminal.rs` | `subak config …`, `subak profile …`, `new --profile` |
| Motion | `gui/motion.rs` | Transitions, `easing.standard`, reduced motion (pure) |
| Chrome | `gui/screens.rs` (`Chrome`) | `kim-dark` and `kim-light` chrome tokens; retinting the window's VT parts |
| Tabs | `gui/tabs.rs` (`layout_hover`) | The hover fill |
| Renderer | `subak-term` (`render::font_chain`, `Renderer::set_options`, `Theme::kim_light`, `TermView::set_word_delimiters`) | Font chain, line height, padding, bold-as-bright, the light palette, word separators |
| Window | `gui/window.rs` | Loading and reloading, the menu, profiles on `Ctrl+T`, opacity, the motion timer, hover, icon, toasts, mouse and keyboard choices |

### 13.7 Measurements

This machine: Windows 10 Pro 22H2 19045, Intel Core i5-13600KF, 2026-11-04. The Milestone B
baseline (startup, journey latencies, idle cost of the window and the Host) is in
[MILESTONE_B_VALIDATION.md](MILESTONE_B_VALIDATION.md).

| What | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Idle, debug build, attached, 10 s (`gui_window.rs::idle_window_costs_no_cpu_and_little_memory`) | 0.0 ms CPU, 4.68 MiB private, 15.35 MiB working set, 6 threads, 180 handles (Step 17: 4.38 MiB, 13.5 MiB, 157 handles); no timer while idle (the motion timer runs only during a transition) |
| Binary sizes (release, shipped features) | `subak-gui.exe` 2 974 720 → **3 370 496** bytes (settings, the TOML parser, menus, motion, the light theme); `subak.exe` 2 100 224 → **2 506 240** bytes (the TOML parser and the `config`/`profile` commands) |
| `subak.exe` still carries no window code | `grep -c -a` on the release binaries: `CreateWindowExW`, `SetLayeredWindowAttributes`, `TrackMouseEvent`, `RegGetValueW`, `ShellExecuteW`, `SetDIBitsToDevice` — 0 in `subak.exe`, 1 each in `subak-gui.exe` |
| A transition | 120 ms (tab) or 160 ms (banner) at 16 ms frames, then the timer stops (`gui_settings.rs::transitions_run_briefly_and_reduced_motion_runs_none`) |

### 13.8 Keyboard and accessibility

Every setting is reachable by keyboard: the Menu key opens the pane menu, whose **Settings**
submenu holds every choice (arrows, Enter; Esc closes); every shortcut stays rebindable with
`subak hotkeys` (the window's actions are unchanged by this Step). The light and dark chrome meet
the declared WCAG pairs of `design/tokens.json`; state is never colour-only (shapes on tabs,
checks in menus, words in banners). Reduced motion and High Contrast are honoured as §13.5 says.

### 13.9 Manual verification (maintainer)

Agents on this machine never show windows, so these checks are the maintainer's. Build:
`cargo build --release -p subak`; use a private endpoint and look at your own settings file
first (`subak config show`; keep a copy if you have one): `set E=--endpoint subak-manual-20`.

1. `target\release\subak.exe config show`: every setting with `(default)`. `target\release\subak.exe
   config set appearance.theme kim-light`, then `target\release\subak-gui.exe %E%`: the window is
   light (caption, tab bar, pane), Korean text readable; the taskbar shows the watermelon.
2. Right click on the tab bar → Settings → Theme → Kim dark: dark at once; `subak config show`
   says `kim-dark`. Settings → Window opacity → 80 %: the desktop shows through.
3. Settings → Terminal font → Consolas, then Courier New: the text changes; Settings → Line
   spacing → 1.6: rows spread, `subak.exe %E% info 1` shows the pane resized, the same pid.
4. `Ctrl+Plus` three times, close the window, reopen: the same size, theme and opacity.
5. Ctrl+Tab between two tabs: the lilac marker fades in briefly. Turn "Show animations in
   Windows" off (Settings → Accessibility → Visual effects), click into the window, Ctrl+Tab: no
   fade. Settings → Motion → Full: the fade returns despite Windows' setting.
6. Hover the tabs: the one under the pointer lightens, its `×` brighter.
7. Add a profile with Settings → Edit settings file… (Notepad opens):
   `[[profiles]]` / `name = "pwsh"` / `program = "powershell.exe"` / `args = ["-NoLogo"]` /
   `cwd = 'C:\Windows'`, and `default_profile = "pwsh"` under `[terminal]`; save, click into the
   window: `Ctrl+T` opens PowerShell in `C:\Windows`; the tab menu lists "New Terminal: pwsh
   (default)".
8. Settings → Copy on select; drag over a word: Notepad pastes it. Settings → Ctrl+C copies a
   selection; select, `Ctrl+C`: copied; without a selection `Ctrl+C` interrupts `ping -t
   localhost`. Settings → Right click → Open the pane menu: a right click opens it.
9. Break the file (delete a `]`), click into the window: a banner names the line; `Ctrl+Plus`
   says the change applies to this window only; the file is unchanged.
   `subak config reset --all --yes` restores it (`backups\config-invalid-….toml` keeps yours).
10. Turn on a Contrast theme: system colours, opaque even at 80 %; with `theme = "system"` the
    window follows Windows' light or dark app mode.
11. Narrator (`Ctrl+Win+Enter`), the Menu key: the Settings submenu and its checked items are read.
12. Clean up: `subak.exe %E% host stop --kill-terminals --yes`; restore your settings file.

| Manual check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Themes, caption, icon, opacity in the visible window (steps 1–2, 10) | automated off-screen with frames and the window's own report (§13.11); visible run **pending — maintainer** |
| Fonts and line spacing (step 3) | automated (face, cell heights, pane resized, same pid); visible look **pending — maintainer** |
| Persistence across a restart (step 4) | automated; visible run **pending — maintainer** |
| Motion and Windows' animation setting (step 5) | automated with the setting and a simulated Windows value; the real setting and the look **pending — maintainer** |
| Hover (step 6) | automated with posted mouse messages and a frame; real pointer **pending — maintainer** |
| Profiles from the file, Notepad (step 7) | automated (recording opener, real Host, exact argv/cwd/env); Notepad **pending — maintainer** |
| Mouse and `Ctrl+C` choices with the real clipboard (step 8) | automated with the recording clipboard; real clipboard **pending — maintainer** |
| A broken file (step 9) | automated; visible banner **pending — maintainer** |
| Real High Contrast and light mode (step 10), Narrator (step 11) | simulated (`system` test command); real settings and Narrator **pending — maintainer** |

### 13.10 Known limits and tracked deviations (Step 20)

- **No ligatures.** The GDI renderer draws each cell on its own; ligatures need text shaping
  across cells (DirectWrite or Uniscribe), deferred (ADR 0051 §7). The menu says so.
- **No settings page**: the menu and the file cover every setting; profiles are edited in the
  file (or imported). A form-based editor (with a profile editor) is not built.
- Font choices in the menu are a fixed list of common monospace families (the installed ones);
  any other family works through the file.
- No colour schemes beyond the three themes (Tabby `CORE-37`/`38`), no per-profile theme,
  icon or colour (`CORE-24`), no cursor-style or blink setting (`CORE-45`), no Alt-as-Meta or
  backspace mode (`CORE-61`/`62`), no portable mode (`SHELL-24`), no interface language
  (`APP-08`), no welcome tab (`APP-09`), no sign-in start (`APP-07`).
- The integrated title-bar tab bar, tooltips on tabs, an `F6` region cycle and the integrated
  search field of DESIGN_SYSTEM §3.5/§3.8/§4.1 are not built; the tab bar stays in the client
  area and the search bar in the banner row.
- The floating icon and Terminal manager (§11) keep `kim-dark` (and High Contrast); the light
  theme is the window's.
- Opacity is the whole window's (text included); a backdrop that keeps text opaque (Mica,
  acrylic) needs Windows 11 and a different composition path.
- Motion animates the tab marker and banners only; native menus follow Windows' own animation
  setting.

### 13.11 Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/subak/src/config.rs` unit tests | defaults, every key read, invalid values with key and line, broken and newer files, profiles left out with reasons, secret warnings and redaction, in-place edits keeping comments and unknown keys, refusals, reset, atomic writes, backups and pruning, unreadable and non-UTF-8 files, the `gui.json` v1 adoption, differences, theme resolution, the JSON schema |
| `crates/subak/tests/config_cli.rs` | every `config`/`profile` command with golden files (`docs/contracts/examples/subak-cli-v1/config-*.json`, …), refusals and exit codes, backups, import checks; a profile's exact argv, cwd and environment through a real Host; a running pane unchanged by every setting |
| `crates/subak/tests/gui_settings.rs` | light/dark/High Contrast frames pixel by pixel, font family, line height, padding, opacity, motion and reduced motion, profiles on `Ctrl+T` and in the menu, the settings menu saving into `config.toml`, copy on select, smart `Ctrl+C`, right/middle click, word separators, hover, the `gui.json` v1 migration, restart persistence, a broken file never rewritten, running Terminals untouched |
| `crates/subak/tests/config_boundary.rs` | the Host never reads `config.toml`; only the window and the settings commands load it |
| `crates/subak/tests/milestone_b.rs` | the Milestone B journey and its measurements ([MILESTONE_B_VALIDATION](MILESTONE_B_VALIDATION.md)) |
| `crates/subak-term/tests/{render,view}.rs` | line height, padding, bold-as-bright and the light theme in pixels; the font chain (Courier New, Consolas, a missing family); configurable word separators |
| `e2e/tests/step20_subak_polish.rs` (ignored; `cargo xtask e2e` only) | settings and profiles from the CLI into the window and across a restart; the Milestone B journey |

## 14. Split windows (Step 22)

[ADR 0056](adr/0056-subak-pane-splits-and-layout.md). When the shown internal window has more
than one visible pane, the window draws all of them at the places of the Host's layout
([SESSION_MODEL §3](SESSION_MODEL.md)); a window of one pane (or a zoomed pane) looks exactly as
before.

### 14.1 What you see and do

- **Every visible pane at its place.** The active pane is the one keys, the IME, selection,
  search, paste and links go to; the others are drawn live but never typed into. A one-cell gap
  separates panes, with a thin divider; the active pane's dividers are in the accent colour, and
  the other panes show a hollow cursor.
- **Keys** (the shortcut contract's `pane.*` actions, scope `app`, rebindable in `hotkeys.json`;
  the `Ctrl+B` prefix forms are Step 23): `Alt+Shift+Plus` split right (side by side),
  `Alt+Shift+Minus` split down (stacked) — the new pane runs the Host's default shell and becomes
  the active one; `Alt+Left/Right/Up/Down` go to the pane on that side (wrapping); `Alt+Shift+Arrow`
  move the active pane's border (2 columns or 1 row a press, repeating); `Ctrl+Shift+Z` zoom or
  unzoom. `pane.kill` has no direct key (prefix `x` in Step 23): bound by the user, it ends an
  idle pane at once and asks first when the pane runs more than a shell, as `Ctrl+W` does for a
  Terminal. A pane whose program exits gives its space to its neighbour.
- **Mouse:** a click on another pane makes it the active one (the click is not sent to its
  program); dragging a divider moves it, one cell at a time.
- **Sizes:** the window asks the Host for its whole grid; every pane gets its share, and the
  programs see exactly that (`[Console]::WindowWidth`). Several windows on one Terminal show the
  same layout; the last one resized sets the size.

### 14.2 How it works

The model keeps the shown window's layout (`TermInfo.layout`, from `terminal.list`, refreshed on
`window.layout` and the other topology events). The active pane is the window's interactive
attachment, as before, now sized to its place. Each other visible pane is a **read-only
attachment** (`interactive: false`, no history) with its own `TermView` and renderer; panes
nobody sees (another tab, a zoomed window) are detached, so they cost no drawing. The frames are
composed at their places in one frame per change (the pane renderers keep their own damage), and
mouse and cursor positions are offset by the active pane's place. Split, focus, resize, zoom and
kill are IPC requests (`pane.split`, `pane.select` with a `direction`, `pane.adjust`,
`pane.zoom`, `pane.kill`); a refusal is a banner notice.

### 14.3 Known limits (Step 22)

- No per-pane titles or status line in the dividers; no pane-number overlay (`display-panes`,
  Step 25).
- A press on a divider always starts a drag (it does not select a pane).
- Read-only panes are drawn with the same font and theme; their scrollback is not browsable
  until they become the active pane (select them first).
- **Not tested on a visible window with a real mouse yet** (maintainer, manual check below).

### 14.4 Manual check (maintainer)

1. `subak new work`, open it in the window, press `Alt+Shift+Plus` then `Alt+Shift+Minus`: three
   panes, dividers drawn, the newest active (accent dividers).
2. `Alt+Left`, type `dir`: only the left pane runs it. Drag a divider: the panes follow; run
   `mode con` in each pane: Columns/Lines equal the drawn sizes.
3. `Ctrl+Shift+Z`: one pane fills the window; again: back. Close the window, reopen it: the same
   layout. `subak pane ls work` in a console shows the same places.

### 14.5 Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/subak/src/layout.rs` unit tests | splits, minimums, removal and flattening, window resizes, border moves, swap, zoom, rotate, presets, neighbours, the JSON tree |
| `crates/subak/tests/pane_layout.rs` | the real Host: pseudo console sizes seen by programs after every split, resize, zoom, swap and close; directional focus, minimums, dry runs and refusals; the layout across clients; rotate and presets; deep splits and their latency |
| `crates/subak/tests/gui_window.rs::a_split_window_draws_every_pane_and_its_keys_and_mouse_split_focus_resize_and_zoom` | the off-screen window: both and three panes drawn at their places, read-only views, `Alt+Left`, `Alt+Shift+Plus`, `Alt+Shift+Right`, `Ctrl+Shift+Z`, a divider drag, a click, a pane exit, closing the window keeps every pane |
| `e2e/tests/step22_pane_layout.rs` (ignored; `cargo xtask e2e` only) | a user splits, resizes, zooms and rearranges panes with the CLI and the programs see their sizes; the window draws and drives the split |

## 15. The prefix keys and keyboard help (Step 23)

[ADR 0057](adr/0057-subak-prefix-and-key-binding-engine.md). `Ctrl+B` is tmux's prefix: press
it, release, then a key of the table. It acts on the **shown tab's Terminal** — its internal
windows and panes — never on another tab. The banner shows `Ctrl+B` while it waits; there is no
time limit; `Esc` or a click cancels.

### 15.1 The table (defaults; all rebindable with `subak hotkeys set`)

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+B c` / `n` / `p` / `0`–`9` | new internal window / next / previous / window *N* |
| `Ctrl+B ,` / `&` | rename the active window in place / kill it (asks when busy) |
| `Ctrl+B %` / `"` | split side by side / stacked |
| `Ctrl+B` arrows, `o` | focus by direction / the next pane |
| `Ctrl+B Ctrl+Arrow`, `Alt+Arrow` | resize by 1 / by 5 (repeat without the prefix for `terminal.repeat_time_ms`) |
| `Ctrl+B z` / `x` | zoom / kill the pane (asks when busy) |
| `Ctrl+B {` / `}`, `Ctrl+O` / `Alt+O` | swap with the previous / next pane, rotate forwards / backwards |
| `Ctrl+B Alt+1` / `Alt+2` / `Alt+5` | even-horizontal / even-vertical / tiled |
| `Ctrl+B r`, `d`, `$`, `?` | redraw, detach (closes the window; nothing ends), rename the Terminal, help |
| `Ctrl+B Ctrl+B` | sends one `Ctrl+B` to the program |
| `Ctrl+B Ctrl+T`, `Ctrl+B Ctrl+W`, `Ctrl+B Ctrl+Tab`, … | the tab shortcut's keys go to the program instead (pass-through) |

An unbound key after the prefix does nothing and says so; the next key is typed again. `Ctrl+C`
alone always reaches the program. While the IME composes (Hangul, Japanese), keys belong to the
input method and the prefix does not trigger; the rename field, a confirmation, a question and
the help take their own keys. A password prompt cannot be detected in a terminal, so the prefix
behaves the same there (as in tmux).

### 15.2 Help, configuration and profiles

- `F1` (or `Ctrl+B ?`) shows every shortcut as bound now (the prefix spelled out) with its title,
  in the pane's place; Up/Down/PageUp/PageDown scroll; `Esc`, `Enter`, `q` or `F1` close it.
- The prefix: `"leaders": {"prefix": "Ctrl+A"}` in `hotkeys.json` moves the whole table (and gives
  `Ctrl+B` back to programs). The console client (`subak attach`) follows the same prefix when it
  is a `Ctrl+<letter>`, and `client.detach`'s character.
- `terminal.repeat_time_ms` in `config.toml` (0–2000, default 500; 0 off): tmux `repeat-time`.
- `subak-gui --hotkeys-profile <name>` applies the `profiles` overlay `<name>` of `hotkeys.json`
  for that run.

### 15.3 Known limits (Step 23)

- No custom key tables, `prefix2`, `last-window`, `last-pane`, describe-key or command prompt
  (Steps 24–25); `Ctrl+B ,` and `Ctrl+B $` rename in place instead of tmux's prompt.
- **Not tested with a visible window, a real keyboard and a real IME yet** (manual check below).

### 15.4 Manual check (maintainer)

1. Open a Terminal; `Ctrl+B c`, `Ctrl+B n`, `Ctrl+B p`, `Ctrl+B 0`: windows come and go in that tab
   only (`subak window ls` agrees). `Ctrl+B %`, `Ctrl+B "`, arrows, `Ctrl+B z`.
2. In `cmd.exe`: `Ctrl+B Ctrl+B` prints `^B`; `Ctrl+B Ctrl+W` types `^W` and closes nothing.
3. With the Korean IME on, type Hangul while pressing `Ctrl+B`: the composition is not broken.
4. `F1`, scroll, `Esc`. `Ctrl+B d`: the window closes; `subak ls` shows every Terminal running.

### 15.5 Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/subak/src/gui/keys.rs` unit tests | the table, layouts (`char:%` on any key), pass-through, unbound keys, `Esc`, `Ctrl+C`, repeat-time, a rebound leader, profiles |

## 16. The command prompt, copy mode and paste buffers (Step 24)

[ADR 0058](adr/0058-subak-tmux-commands-copy-mode-and-buffers.md).

### 16.1 The command prompt (`Ctrl+B :`)

The banner row becomes a line for tmux commands (the same parser as `subak command`, SUBAK_CLI
§3.16): `Enter` runs it, `Esc` cancels, Up/Down recall earlier lines (kept while the window
runs). Commands without `-t` act on the shown Terminal — its active pane *when they run*, so
`split-window; select-pane -L` behaves as in tmux. `list-panes`, `list-windows`,
`list-sessions`, `list-buffers`, `show-buffer` and `capture-pane` show their answer in the pane's
place (Esc closes it); an error is a banner notice. `kill-pane`/`kill-window` ask first when the
Host says the target is busy. `copy-mode` and `detach-client` work as their keys do.

### 16.2 Copy mode (`Ctrl+B [`, `Ctrl+B PageUp`)

The pane's screen and history are browsed with the keyboard; **no key reaches the program** while
it is on (the program keeps running and printing). The banner says so.

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| arrows, `h j k l` | move |
| `w` `b`, `Ctrl+Left/Right` | next / previous word (`terminal.word_separators`) |
| `0` `^` `$`, `Home` `End` | line start / end |
| `g` `G`, `Ctrl+Home/End` | oldest line / live screen |
| `PageUp` `PageDown`, `Ctrl+U` `Ctrl+D` | a page |
| `/` `?`, `n` `N` | search (the search bar), next / previous match |
| `Space` | begin a selection; moves extend it |
| `Enter` | copy the selection into a new paste buffer **and** the clipboard, and leave |
| `q`, `Escape`, `Ctrl+C` | leave |

`Space`, `Enter` and `q`/`Escape` are the contract's `copy-mode` actions (rebindable); the
movement keys are fixed for now. The mouse selection of §12 keeps working outside copy mode.

### 16.3 Paste buffers

`Ctrl+B ]` types the newest buffer into the active pane; `Ctrl+B #` lists the buffers in the
pane's place; `Ctrl+B -` deletes the newest. The buffers are the Host's (in memory only), shared
with `subak buffer` and every window. `Ctrl+B !` breaks the active pane out into a window of its
own.

### 16.4 Known limits (Step 24)

- No emacs copy keys, rectangle or line selection, repeat counts, `copy-pipe`, marks or jumps;
  no bracketed paste for buffers; no prompt templates (`-I`, `-p`); formats (`-F`) are Step 25.
- **Not tested with a visible window and a real keyboard yet** (manual check below).

### 16.5 Manual check (maintainer)

1. `Ctrl+B :` `split-window -h; select-pane -L` Enter: two panes, the left active. `Ctrl+B :`
   `list-panes` Enter: the table; Esc.
2. Print some lines; `Ctrl+B [`, move up with `k`, `0`, `Space`, `$`, `Enter`: copied (also in the
   clipboard). `Ctrl+B ]`: typed at the prompt. `subak buffer ls` lists it.

### 16.6 Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/subak/src/tmuxcmd.rs` unit tests | words, quotes, escapes, `;`, comments, flags and aliases, stable errors, refused relative targets, plans and consent, `send-keys` key names |
| `crates/subak/tests/tmux_commands.rs` | the real Host: chains, `break-pane`/`join-pane` keeping the process, `send-keys`, the pane context (`SUBAK_PANE_ID`), dry runs, errors, `--yes`; buffers: order, redacted previews, paste as input, the limit |
| `crates/subak/tests/gui_window.rs::the_command_prompt_and_copy_mode_work_on_the_shown_terminal` | the off-screen window: the prompt, an answer view, an unknown command, copy mode swallowing keys, a copied line, `Ctrl+B ]` |
| `e2e/tests/step24_tmux_commands.rs` (ignored; `cargo xtask e2e` only) | the same journeys on the real binaries |

## 17. Advanced tmux behaviours in the window (Step 25)

[ADR 0059](adr/0059-subak-advanced-tmux-behaviours.md).

### 17.1 Keys

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+B Alt+3` / `Alt+4` | `main-horizontal` / `main-vertical` layout |
| `Ctrl+B Alt+6` / `Alt+7` | the mirrored main layouts |
| `Ctrl+B Space` | the next layout preset (tmux's order) |
| `Ctrl+B E` | spread the panes out evenly |
| `Ctrl+B l` / `Ctrl+B ;` | the previous window / pane |
| `Ctrl+B i` | where you are (`display-message`) in the banner |

The prompt (`Ctrl+B :`) runs the new commands too: `setw synchronize-panes on`, `show-options`
and `show-hooks` (answers in the pane's place), `display-message '#S:#I.#P'` (the banner),
`set-hook …`, `last-window`, `list-commands`.

### 17.2 Window list and alerts

When a Terminal has several windows or a window has an alert, the title shows tmux's window list,
e.g. `work [window 0:cmd pane 0 (2 windows, 2 panes)] {0:cmd* 1:logs-!}`: `*` shown, `-` the
previous window, `#` output (`monitor-activity`), `!` a bell (`monitor-bell`, on by default),
`Z` a zoomed pane. Showing a window clears its flags. A drawn status line is a follow-up (F4,
#97).

### 17.3 Manual check (maintainer)

1. `Ctrl+B "` twice, then `Ctrl+B Alt+4`: one pane on the left, two stacked on the right;
   `Ctrl+B Space` cycles.
2. `Ctrl+B :` `setw synchronize-panes on` Enter, type `echo hi` Enter: every pane runs it.
3. `Ctrl+B c`, `Ctrl+B l`: back and forth. In window 1 run `timeout 3 & echo ^G` (type Ctrl+G),
   switch away quickly: the title shows `1:cmd-!`.

### 17.4 Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/subak/src/layout.rs::tests::main_presets_cycle_and_spread` | main presets, mirrored, the cycle, small windows, spread |
| `crates/subak/src/tmuxcmd.rs::tests::step_25_commands_tokens_and_formats` | the new commands, tokens, refusals, formats |
| `crates/subak/src/session.rs::tests::targets_resolve_names_ids_and_indexes_exactly` | tokens resolved by the Host |
| `crates/subak-term/src/screen.rs::tests::bells_count_controls_not_osc_terminators` | bells vs OSC terminators |
| `crates/subak/tests/tmux_advanced.rs` | the real Host: layouts, synchronized input, last window/pane, tokens, formats, alerts, hooks |
| `e2e/tests/step25_advanced_tmux.rs` (ignored; `cargo xtask e2e` only) | the same journeys on the real binaries |

## 18. Claude Code states on the tabs (Step 28)

[ADR 0062](adr/0062-claude-code-status-indicators.md), [CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md](CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md).
Only after `subak claude hooks install`; nothing is ever guessed.

| Mark (after the status) | State | Title adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `!` (warning) | need-input: a permission prompt or a question | (Claude needs input) |
| `✕` (danger) | error: the turn ended on an API error | (Claude error) |
| `✓` (success) | done: the turn finished | (Claude done) |
| `◔` (accent) | in-progress | (Claude working) |
| `?` (muted) | unknown: no hook for 30 minutes while working | (Claude state unknown) |
| `◦` (muted) | idle: a session started, no prompt yet | (Claude idle) |

A Terminal with several Claude panes shows the most urgent (need-input > error > done >
in-progress > unknown > idle). The floating icon and the manager rows use the same states and
order (their tooltips and rows say them in words). `terminal.claude_indicators = false` hides the
tab marks and the title words.

**Tests:** `crates/subak/src/gui/tabs.rs::tests::claude_marks_are_distinct_shapes_beside_the_status`,
`gui/model.rs::tests::claude_states_reach_the_tabs_from_the_list_and_events`,
`gui/float/list.rs::tests::claude_changes_reach_the_row_and_the_icon_without_a_list`,
`crates/subak/tests/gui_window.rs::claude_states_mark_the_tabs_and_the_title_in_words` (off-screen
window), `crates/subak/tests/claude_status.rs` (Host states, stale and lost signals).

**Manual check (maintainer, not tested by the agent):** install the hooks, run `claude` in a tab,
ask something that needs a permission: the tab shows `!` and the title "(Claude needs input)";
answer it: `◔`; when Claude finishes: `✓`.

## 19. Detected shells in the window (Step 33)

The `+` and tab menu lists "New Terminal: <profile>" for the profiles of `config.toml` and the
shells found on this PC (PowerShell 7, Windows PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash, WSL
distributions; [ADR 0066](adr/0066-detected-shell-profiles-and-shell-integration.md));
`Ctrl+B N` opens it from the keyboard. `terminal.detect_shells = false` hides the detected ones.
**Manual check (maintainer, not tested by the agent):** `Ctrl+B N`, pick "Git Bash": a bash
prompt in a new tab.

## 20. SSH profiles in the window (Step 34)

SSH profiles (`ssh = "user@host:port"`, [ADR 0067](adr/0067-ssh-through-windows-openssh-and-credential-manager.md))
appear in the New Terminal menu with the others. ssh's own questions (a new host's fingerprint, a
password when none is saved) are answered in the pane. **Manual check (maintainer, not tested by
the agent):** add an SSH profile, open it from `Ctrl+B N`, answer the fingerprint question.

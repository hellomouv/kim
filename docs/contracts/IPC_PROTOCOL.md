# Subak IPC protocol v1

Status: **implemented v1** (Step 09; Terminal methods added in Step 10, environment overrides
in Step 11, verbatim command lines and `client.detach` in Step 12, terminal-state snapshots,
`pane.resync`, `pane.capture` and `pane.clear_history` in Step 13, internal windows and panes in
Step 21, as additive changes; frozen:

Machine-readable schema: [schemas/ipc-v1.schema.json](schemas/ipc-v1.schema.json). Valid and
invalid example messages live in [examples/ipc-v1/](examples/ipc-v1/hello.json) and are checked by
`cargo xtask schema-check`, which is part of `cargo test`. Beyond the examples,
`crates/subak/src/proto.rs` validates every message this build constructs against the schema, and
`crates/subak/tests/host_ipc.rs`, `crates/subak/tests/session_lifecycle.rs` and `crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs` validate every
control message a real Host sends. Events with a known name have typed data in the schema; the
results of the Terminal methods are typed by its `result_*` definitions (a response does not name
its method, so the tests check each result against its definition directly).

The Step 08 prototype ([CONPTY_PROOF](../CONPTY_PROOF.md), [ADR 0016](../adr/0016-conpty-host-validation.md))
spoke protocol major **0** with this framing. A v1 Host refuses it with `protocol_unsupported`.

## 1. Transport and framing

Per-user named pipe `\\.\pipe\mouv-subak-<user SID>-s<session id>`. It is local only
(`PIPE_REJECT_REMOTE_CLIENTS`), its first instance is created with
`FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE`, and it carries an owner-only DACL: allow the user, deny
`NETWORK`. All I/O is overlapped on both ends (ADR 0016 §7). Each frame:

```
u32 LE length | u8 kind | payload (length - 1 bytes)
```

| kind | name | payload | limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x01` | control | UTF-8 JSON object (one message) | 256 KiB |
| `0x02` | data | `u32 LE stream_id` · `u64 LE seq` · `u8 flags` · bytes | 1 MiB of bytes |

Data `flags`: bit 0 = snapshot (Host → client: the bytes reproduce the pane's terminal as it was
at output position `seq`; live output continues with the frame whose `seq` is that same value; a
snapshot may span several consecutive frames, all with that `seq`; until Step 12 the bytes were
raw recent output and `seq` the offset of their first byte), bit 1 = input (client → Host). Other
bits must be zero. A client may send only data frames whose flags are exactly `input`. For live
output (`flags` 0), `seq` is the offset of the frame's first byte in the pane's output, so each
frame's `seq` is the previous one's plus its length.

**Limits and timeouts** (enforced by the Host):

| What | Limit | On violation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frame length | checked from the 5-byte header, before anything is allocated | `protocol_error`, close |
| `hello` | the whole frame within 5 s of connecting | `timeout` (nothing arrived) or `protocol_error` (incomplete), close |
| Any later frame | complete within 10 s of its first byte | `protocol_error`, close |
| Idle connection | no limit; heartbeats are the client's choice (`host.health`) | — |
| Connections | 64 at once (in handshake or established) | handshake error `busy`, close |
| Send queue per connection | 16 MiB, each queued frame counting its bytes plus 64 (Step 11; until Step 10 also at most 4096 frames) | output that does not fit: that stream's queued output is dropped and it is resynced once the queue drained to 4 MiB (`pane.resync`, Step 13; until Step 12 the client was disconnected); a control message that does not fit: the client is disconnected; the pane never waits ([SCROLLBACK §5](../SCROLLBACK.md)) |

A violation closes **that connection only**. The Host first sends a connection-level error
`{"type":"error","error":{…}}` when it can. It never panics on input; a panic in a request
handler becomes `internal_error` and the Host continues (ADR 0019 §9).

## 2. Handshake and identity

1. **The client verifies the server before sending anything.** It takes the server pid from
   `GetNamedPipeServerProcessId` and checks that this process runs as the same user (token user
   SID) and that its image file name is `subak.exe`. Otherwise it refuses: CLI error
   `host_identity_mismatch` (exit 4), and nothing was sent.
2. Client → `{"type":"hello","protocol":{"min":1,"max":1},"client":{"name":"subak-cli","version":"0.0.1","kind":"cli"}}`.
   `client.name` and `client.version` are 1–64 printable characters. `client.kind` is one of
   `cli`, `gui`, `hook`, `mcp`.
3. **The Host verifies the client** from the token of the connection itself (identification-level
   impersonation, ADR 0019 §2). If its user SID differs from the Host's, the Host answers
   `unauthorized` and closes.
4. Version negotiation: the Host picks the highest protocol major in both ranges.
5. Host → `{"type":"welcome","protocol":1,"host":{"version":"0.0.1","pid":1234,"started_at":"…"},"features":[…]}`.
   The client checks that `host.pid` is the pid it verified.

   Otherwise the Host sends `{"type":"error","error":{"code":…,"message":…,"details":{…}}}` and
   closes:

   | Code | When |
   | --- | --- |
   | `protocol_unsupported` | no common major; `details.supported` = `{min, max}` of the Host |
   | `protocol_error` | not a valid `hello` (wrong type, missing or malformed fields, unknown kind, a data frame) |
   | `timeout` | no frame within 5 s |
   | `unauthorized` | the connection's user is not the Host's user |
   | `busy` | 64 connections are already open |
   | `host_stopping` | the Host is shutting down |

`features` of the Step 13 Host: `host.health`, `host.stats`, `events.subscribe`,
`identity.verified`, `terminal.lifecycle`, `terminal.environment` (Step 11: `terminal.create`
takes `env`, panes report `executable` and their override names), `terminal.command_line`
(Step 12: `terminal.create` takes a verbatim `command_line`, panes report it redacted),
`client.detach` (Step 12: the `client.detach` method, the `pane.detached` event and client `id`s
in `host.status`), `pane.snapshot` (Step 13: `pane.attach` sends a terminal-state snapshot and
its `snapshot` result; lagging clients get `pane.resync`) and `pane.capture` (Step 13:
`pane.capture`, `pane.clear_history`, pane `history`, `host.status.scrollback`) and, since Step 21,
`terminal.windows` (§4.4: internal windows and panes, `window.*`, `pane.create`, `pane.list`,
`pane.select`, `pane.kill` and their events). The Step 13 Host lacked the last one; the Step 12
Host also the two before it, the Step 11 Host also `terminal.command_line` and `client.detach`, the
Step 10 Host also
`terminal.environment`; the Step 09 Host announced `prototype.single_pane` instead of
`terminal.lifecycle`. Clients must ignore features they do not know.

## 3. Requests, responses, events

```
request   {"type":"request","id":<u64>,"method":"<name>","params":{…}}
response  {"type":"response","id":<u64>,"ok":true,"result":{…}}
          {"type":"response","id":<u64>,"ok":false,"error":{"code":"…","message":"…","details":{…}}}
event     {"type":"event","seq":<u64>,"event":"<name>","data":{…}}
```

- `id` is chosen by the client, unique per connection. Responses arrive in request order;
  `host.stop` and `pane.attach` answer once their work is queued or done.
- `message` is human-readable English and may change; **`code` is the stable contract**.
- Events are delivered only after `events.subscribe`, with a per-connection `seq`.
- After `welcome`, a control message that is not a request, or whose `id` is not a non-negative
  integer, is a `protocol_error` and closes the connection. A malformed `method` gets
  `unknown_request`, and `params` that are not an object get `invalid_params`
  (`details.field = "params"`); the connection stays open.
- Default client timeout: 10 s per request (30 s for `host.stop`).

## 4. Methods (v1)

Authorization is checked against this whole table, including methods of later Steps, before
anything else. A method a kind may not call answers `unauthorized`. A permitted method that this
Host does not implement yet answers `unknown_request`, as does any name not in the table.

`mcp*` = only once the user granted that capability to MCP clients (Step 37). Until then MCP
clients may call only the unstarred methods. Bold Step = implemented by the Step 21 Host.

**Snapshots, history and capture (Step 13, [SCROLLBACK.md](../SCROLLBACK.md)).** The Host feeds
every pane's output into a terminal model. `pane.attach` answers with `seq` and `snapshot`, then
sends the snapshot (`snapshot.bytes` in `snapshot.frames` data frames flagged *snapshot*, all at
`seq`) and then live output from `seq` on; response, snapshot and live output are taken under the
lock the pane's reader holds, so nothing is lost, duplicated or reordered. The snapshot is VT for a
terminal of `snapshot.size` in its default state: up to `history_lines` history rows (default all
kept; `0` none) scrolled into that terminal's scrollback, the screens, modes and cursor, and the
start of a sequence that was still incomplete. `replay_bytes` equals `snapshot.bytes`.
`pane.capture` takes a target of any level, also a `stopped` Terminal (its screen is kept until
it is removed; `invalid_state` for one that never started), or none when exactly one pane has a
screen; `start`/`end` are line numbers (screen rows from 0, history lines from -1, the newest,
down) or `"-"` (the oldest history line, the last screen row), defaulting to the screen;
`format: "vt"` keeps SGR sequences, `join` joins wrapped rows, and `redact` (default `true`)
replaces secret-looking values with `***` and counts them in `redacted`. At most 192 KiB of lines
per answer: older ones are left out, `truncated` is true and `start` is the first line returned.
`screen` is `{size, alternate, cursor: {x, y, visible}}`; `history` is the pane's counters.
`pane.clear_history` deletes the pane's history (not its screen); `dry_run` shows the counts.
Typed by `result_pane_attach`, `result_pane_capture` and `result_pane_clear_history`.

**Panes and streams (Step 10).** A Host owns any number of Terminals, each with internal windows
and panes (one of each until Step 21; docs/SESSION_MODEL.md). Each pane has its own data stream
id, unique in the Host.
`pane.attach` takes a target of any level (a Terminal or window means its active pane; ADR 0007
syntax), or no target when the Host has exactly one running pane (`target_not_found` with none,
for example a Host started with `--no-shell`; `ambiguous_target` with `details.candidates` when
there are several). A Terminal that is not `running` cannot be attached (`invalid_state`). A
connection may attach to several panes; `pane.detach` without `stream_id` detaches all of them.
`interactive: false` makes a read-only viewer: it receives output, but its input frames are
dropped and it may not resize (`invalid_state`). `pane.resize` needs an interactive attach; with
several, `stream_id` names the pane. Input frames carry the stream id and reach a pane only from
a connection interactively attached to that stream while its Terminal runs; all others are
dropped and counted (`host.stats` `ipc.input_frames_dropped`). Detaching, disconnecting or
crashing never changes a Terminal.

**Detaching other clients (Step 12).** `client.detach` ends attachments of *other* connections:
with `target` (any level, as for `pane.attach`) every attachment to the panes it names; with
`client_id` (the `id` of a `host.status` client) every attachment of that connection; with both,
that connection's attachments to that target. An unknown `client_id` is `target_not_found`; no
matching attachment is an empty `detached` list. Each entry is `{client: {id, pid, kind, name},
stream_id, pane_id, terminal_id, interactive}`; `terminal` is `{id, name}` of the resolved target,
or `null`. It changes no process, Terminal or connection. A detached connection subscribed to
`panes` receives `pane.detached` in the critical section that removes the attachment, so the
event precedes the end of its output. `dry_run` lists what would be detached. Typed by
`result_client_detach` in the schema.

**Object shapes** (`Terminal`, `Window`, `Pane`) follow the state schema
([STATE_SCHEMA.md](STATE_SCHEMA.md)) plus volatile fields (`state`, `pid` hint, `exit_code`,
`clients`, `claude_state`). `target` follows [ADR 0007](../adr/0007-object-identity-and-naming.md).

### 4.1 `host.status` result

```json
{ "protocol": 1, "endpoint": "\\\\.\\pipe\\mouv-subak-S-1-5-21-…-s1",
  "host": { "pid": 1234, "version": "0.0.1", "started_at": "2026-11-04T01:02:03Z", "uptime_s": 42,
            "session_id": 1, "job_breakaway": true, "in_job": false,
            "job": null, "stopping": false, "idle_exit_s": 10, "environment": "user" },
  "terminals": 1,
  "pane": { "id": "p-9b0e7d6c5a41", "pid": 5678, "command": "C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe",
            "running": true, "exit_code": null, "size": {"cols": 120, "rows": 30},
            "job_processes": 1, "output_bytes": 2048 },
  "clients": { "connected": 2, "attached": 1,
               "list": [ {"pid": 4321, "kind": "cli", "name": "subak-cli", "version": "0.0.1",
                          "attached": true, "interactive": true, "topics": ["panes", "host"]} ] } }
```

`host.job` is `{kill_on_close, breakaway_ok, silent_breakaway_ok}` of the Host's immediate job,
or `null` outside any job (risk R-03). `host.environment` is `user` (built with
`CreateEnvironmentBlock`) or `inherited` (fallback). `terminals` counts live Terminals
(`starting`, `running`, `stopping`) and the additive `terminals_total` all of them. `pane` is the
pane of the Terminal the Host was started with (`--shell`; it also carries `terminal_id`) while
that Terminal exists, else `null`; use `terminal.list` for the others. Each client lists the
`streams` it is attached to and, since Step 12, its `id` (unique per Host for its lifetime; the
list is ordered by it), which `client.detach` takes. Since Step 13, `scrollback` is `{panes, lines,
bytes, memory_bytes, default_limit_lines, limit_bytes_per_pane, persisted: false}`: the panes
whose screen the Host keeps, their history rows and bytes, the memory of their models, the
default and per-pane limits (typed by the `scrollback` definition).

### 4.2 `host.stats` result

Numbers only (ADR 0012): `host.{uptime_s, handle_count, memory: {working_set_bytes,
private_bytes, peak_private_bytes}}` (memory since Step 11), `terminals` (live), `terminals_total`,
`panes` (running), `clients`, `pane.{output_bytes_total, input_bytes_total}` (all panes, also
ended ones), `sessions.{created_total, spawn_failures_total, removed_total}`, and
`ipc.{connections_total,
rejected.{identity, limit, handshake, stopping}, requests_total, errors_total.{<code>: n},
protocol_errors, panics, input_frames_dropped, lagging_clients_dropped, lagging_resyncs,
output_frames_skipped}` (the last two since Step 13), and since Step 13 `scrollback.{panes, lines,
bytes, memory_bytes, evicted_lines_total, cleared_lines_total, snapshots_total,
snapshot_bytes_total, captures_total}`.

### 4.3 Terminal methods (Step 10)

Semantics, states and rules are in [SESSION_MODEL.md](../SESSION_MODEL.md); the object shapes are
the `terminal`, `window`, `pane` and `terminal_summary` definitions of the schema.

- **Terminal object** (`terminal.info`, `terminal.list` with `detail: "full"`, `terminal.create`,
  the `terminal.created` event): `{id, name, created_at, state, profile, remain_on_exit, busy,
  clients, active_window, windows: [{id, index, name, automatic_name, active_pane, layout,
  panes: [{id, index, cwd, command: {program, args}, executable, env: {set, unset}, title,
  stream_id, pid, running, processes, size, clients, output_bytes, history}]}], failure, last_exit}`.
  `history` (Step 13) is `{lines, bytes, limit_lines, limit_bytes, evicted_lines, cleared_lines,
  total_lines, persisted: false}` while the Host keeps the pane's screen, else `null`.
  `executable` (Step 11) is the program file that runs (`null` until it started); `env` lists
  the **names** of its environment overrides, never their values. `state` is `starting`, `running`,
  `stopping`, `stopped` or `failed`. `failure` is `{code: "spawn_failed", reason, message}` for a
  kept failed start; `last_exit` is `{pid, exit_code, forced, cause}` once its processes ended.
  Secret-looking arguments (`--token=…`, the value after `--password`) are shown as `***`. The
  summary (`detail: "summary"`, the default) is `{id, name, state, created_at, busy, clients,
  windows, panes, pid, program}`. Terminals are listed in creation order.
- **`terminal.create`**: `name` follows the naming rules (`invalid_name`, `name_conflict` with
  `details.existing`); without it the lowest free number is used. `command` is `{program, args}`
  (default: the Host's `%ComSpec%`): `program` is a path (relative to `cwd`) or a bare name the
  Host looks up on the pane's `PATH`; every argument is one word, quoted for Windows, never
  passed through a shell; batch and PowerShell scripts are refused (`not_executable`).
  `command_line` (Step 12; exclusive with `command`, else `invalid_params` with
  `details.field = "command_line"`) is one verbatim Windows command line, for programs that parse
  their own (`cmd.exe /c`): it is passed to `CreateProcessW` unchanged, only its first word is
  resolved as `program` is, and `command` becomes its split; panes and `would_create` report it
  as `command_line` with secret-looking words as `***` (`null` for word-by-word commands; the
  `--shell` Terminal of `host serve` reports its line too).
  `cwd` is an absolute path (default: the user profile). `env` (Step 11) is
  `{NAME: "value" | null}`: a string sets a variable, `null` removes it, on top of the user's
  fresh logon environment; `SUBAK_PANE_ID` and `SUBAK_TERMINAL_ID` are always set by the Host and
  may not appear; at most 256 names (1–255 characters, no `=`), values up to 32 767 characters;
  anything else is `invalid_params` with `details.field = "env"`. Values are never stored or
  shown ([PTY_PROCESSES §3](../PTY_PROCESSES.md)). `size` `{cols, rows}` (default 120×30).
  `history_limit` (Step 13) is the number of history rows the pane keeps, 0–100 000 (default
  2 000; `invalid_params` with `details.field = "history_limit"` otherwise); `would_create`
  reports it.
  `remain_on_exit` keeps the Terminal as `stopped` when its program exits; `keep_on_failure`
  keeps a failed start as `failed`. A start that fails answers `spawn_failed` with
  `details.{reason, program, kept, terminal_id}`, plus `hint` and `os_error` when there are
  some, and leaves no job or (without `keep_on_failure`) record; failures the Host can decide
  before starting (§6 reasons except some `other`) do not even create a pseudo console. `dry_run`
  makes the same checks (name, working directory, the program on the pane's `PATH`, scripts)
  and creates nothing; `would_create` adds the resolved `executable` and the `env` names.
  `profile` is part of v1 but refused with `invalid_params` until Step 33.
- **`terminal.rename`**: a Terminal may change the case of its own name; another Terminal's name
  is `name_conflict`. The id, processes and attachments stay.
- **`terminal.stop`** ends the processes gracefully, then forced (SESSION_MODEL §4), and keeps the
  Terminal (`stopped`); on a Terminal that runs nothing it is a no-op (`affected: []`).
  **`terminal.kill`** ends them at once and removes the Terminal (also a stored one).
  **`terminal.remove`** removes a Terminal that runs nothing and answers `invalid_state` for a
  running one unless `force` is set (then it is a kill). A running Terminal that is *busy* (more
  than an idle shell) is refused with `busy` (its plan in `details`) unless `force` is set;
  clients set `force` only after the user confirmed. All three answer `invalid_state` while the
  Terminal is `starting`, take only a Terminal target (a name or `t-` id; pane or window ids are
  `invalid_params`), and answer once the processes have ended (clients allow 30 s). `affected`
  lists one report per ended pane: `{terminal_id, pane_id, pid, exit_code, processes_in_job,
  forced, job_processes_left}`. A request that arrives while another one ends the same pane gets
  the same report; a kill during a graceful stop ends the job at once.

### 4.4 Windows and panes (Step 21)

Semantics are in [SESSION_MODEL.md](../SESSION_MODEL.md) §1–§5 and
[ADR 0054](../adr/0054-subak-internal-windows-and-panes.md); results are typed by
`result_window_create`, `result_topology`, `result_select`, `result_window_rename` and
`result_close` (with `would_create_pane`, `selection` and `close_plan`).

- **Levels.** Each method takes exactly the level in the table above; any other is
  `invalid_params` (`details.field = "target"`). A window or pane id is looked up only inside the
  Terminal the target names (`work:w-…` of another Terminal is `target_not_found`).
- **`window.create` / `pane.create`** take the program parameters of `terminal.create` (`command`
  or `command_line`, `cwd`, `env`, `size`, `history_limit`; same checks and errors) plus `name`
  (window only; the window name rules) and `select` (default `true`). Only in a `running` Terminal
  that nothing ends (`invalid_state` otherwise). The window takes the lowest free index; the pane
  the next index of its window. The answer comes once the process runs; `window` is the window
  that holds the new pane. Limits: 64 panes per Terminal, 512 running panes per Host (`busy`).
  `dry_run` answers `would_create` (`terminal_id`, `terminal`, `window_id` (pane.create),
  `window_index` and `window_name` (window.create), `select`, and the resolved program as in
  `terminal.create`'s plan) and starts nothing.
- **`window.list` / `pane.list`** answer the Terminal's windows (in index order) with their panes,
  `pane.list` of a window only that window.
- **`window.select` / `pane.select`** set the Terminal's active window, or a window's active pane
  and that window. `changed` is false when nothing changed (then no event). Allowed in every state.
- **`window.rename`** sets the name and clears `automatic_name`.
- **`window.kill` / `pane.kill`** end the processes of the window's panes or of the pane at once
  (job termination, as `terminal.kill`) and take them out of the Terminal; a window goes with its
  last pane. A busy pane needs `force` (`busy` with the `close_plan` in `details`). The last
  running window or pane of a Terminal is `invalid_state` (`details.reason` `last_window` or
  `last_pane`): only `terminal.kill` ends a Terminal. `affected` lists one `pane_end_report` per
  ended pane; `terminal` is the Terminal afterwards.
- **Terminal methods** act on every pane since Step 21: `terminal.stop`, `.kill`, `.remove` with
  `force` and `host.stop` end all panes of all windows (`affected` has one report per pane;
  `busy` and `processes` of their plans add up the panes); a `stopped` Terminal keeps every window
  and pane.

### 4.5 Splits and the layout (Step 22)

Semantics are in [SESSION_MODEL.md](../SESSION_MODEL.md) §3 and
[ADR 0056](../adr/0056-subak-pane-splits-and-layout.md); feature `terminal.layout`.

- **Layout.** A Window object's `layout` is the split tree of `Layout` (STATE_SCHEMA), with
  `cells` beside each child's `size` share; `size` is the window's size; `zoomed` its zoomed pane
  or null. Pane objects add `rect` (`x`, `y`, `cols`, `rows` in the window) and `visible`.
- **The window's size** is the latest interactive client's: `pane.attach` with a `size` and
  `pane.resize` lay the pane's window out at that size, and every pane whose share changed is
  resized. A read-only attach never resizes. A new window starts at the Terminal's active window's
  size unless `size` is given.
- **`pane.split`** splits the target pane; the new pane starts at its share. Each pane keeps at
  least 2×2 cells; otherwise `invalid_state` with `details.need`/`have`, nothing started.
  `pane.create` is a vertical split of the window's active pane; split options on it are
  `invalid_params`.
- **`window.rotate`** moves every pane one place along the pane order (tmux `rotate-window`;
  `up`: the second pane takes the first place); **`window.select_layout`** arranges every pane in
  pane order evenly side by side, stacked, or tiled (as many columns as the square root of the
  count, rounded up). Both unzoom.
- **`pane.adjust` / `pane.swap` / `pane.zoom` / `window.rotate` / `window.select_layout`** answer `result_layout`: the window's `layout`,
  `size`, `zoomed`, `active_pane`, `panes` (id, index, rect, visible), the target `pane_id`,
  `changed` and (adjust) `moved`. `dry_run` answers `{dry_run: true, would_change}`. Only in a
  running Terminal. Swapping panes of two windows is `invalid_state`. Zooming selects the pane;
  selecting another pane, a split or a border move unzooms.
- **`window.layout`** (topic `terminals`) carries the same data after every change of a window with
  more than one pane: a split, a border move, a swap, a zoom, a pane gone, a client's new size.

### 4.6 Keys, moving panes and paste buffers (Step 24)

Semantics in [ADR 0058](../adr/0058-subak-tmux-commands-copy-mode-and-buffers.md); feature
`terminal.buffers`.

- **`pane.send_keys`** writes tmux key names (`Enter`, `C-c`, `M-x`, `Up`, `F5`, `PPage`, …; any
  other word as its text) or, with `literal`, the words as text, to a running pane as input (at
  most 1 MiB; counted as input; never logged or echoed in results).
- **`pane.break`** moves a pane of a window with other panes into a new window (the lowest free
  index; named `name` or after its program) at the old window's size; `pane.join` moves a pane into
  another window of the **same Terminal** as a split of the target pane (a window target: its
  active pane); a window losing its last pane goes (`window.removed`, reason `joined`). The
  process, screen and stream are unchanged; both windows are laid out again (`window.layout`).
- **Buffers** are kept in the Host's memory only (`persisted: false`): newest first, at most 50 (the
  oldest automatic `bufferN` goes; named ones stay), 1 MiB each, names of 1–64 visible characters.
  `buffer.list` gives names, sizes, line counts and a redacted first line; `buffer.get` the text;
  `buffer.paste` types it into a running pane with line ends as carriage returns. A missing buffer
  is `target_not_found`.

### 4.8 The pane's reported folder (Step 33)

A Pane object has `current_dir`: the directory its shell reported last (OSC 7 or OSC 9;9, sent by
the optional shell integration of [ADR 0066](../adr/0066-detected-shell-profiles-and-shell-integration.md)),
or null. `cwd` stays the folder it started in; `state.json` saves `current_dir` when known.

### 4.7 Window options, alerts, target tokens and hooks (Step 25)

Semantics in [ADR 0059](../adr/0059-subak-advanced-tmux-behaviours.md); feature
`terminal.options`.

- **Targets** take tmux's tokens after a Terminal: `work:` `work:{last}` `work:!` `work:+2`
  `work:{end}`; `work:.{last}` `work:1.{left-of}` `work:.{top-left}` … A Terminal object has
  `last_window` (null until another window was shown).
- **Window objects** have `options` (`synchronize-panes`, `monitor-activity`, `monitor-bell`),
  `activity` and `bell`. With `synchronize-panes`, interactive input and `pane.send_keys` reach
  every running pane of the window (`buffer.paste` does not).
- **Alerts:** output or a BEL in a window that is not shown sets its flag once and sends
  `window.alert`; showing the window clears it.
- **Hooks** run tmux command lines (ADR 0059 §5) on a Host thread after their event; never a shell,
  never `kill-*`; at most 32, 1024 bytes each, memory only.

## 5. Events (v1)

Each event is sent in the same critical section as the change it reports, so a client that
subscribes and then lists sees every later change exactly once, after its list.

| Event | Topic | Data | Since |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host.stopping` | `host` | `{reason: "stop_requested" \| "idle"}`, before the Host ends its panes | 09 |
| `pane.exited` | `panes` | `{pane_id, terminal_id, pid, exit_code}`, after the pane's last output | 09 (`terminal_id` 10) |
| `pane.detached` | `panes` | `{pane_id, terminal_id, stream_id, by: {client_id, pid, kind} \| null}`, to the connection another client's `client.detach` detached, before its output stops | 12 |
| `pane.resync` | `panes` | `{pane_id, terminal_id, stream_id, seq}`, to a connection that fell behind on the stream: the Host dropped output instead of waiting; a snapshot at `seq` follows, then live output from `seq` | 13 |
| `terminal.created` | `terminals` | `{terminal: Terminal}` (state `starting`) | 10 |
| `terminal.state_changed` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, name, state, previous_state, cause}`; `cause` is `stopped`, `killed`, `exited`, `host_stopped` or `null` | 10 |
| `terminal.renamed` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, name, previous_name}` | 10 |
| `terminal.removed` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, name, reason}`; `reason` is `killed`, `removed`, `exited`, `spawn_failed` or `host_stopping` | 10 |
| `window.created` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, window: Window}` (with its first pane, running) | 21 |
| `window.renamed` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, window_id, name, previous_name}` | 21 |
| `window.removed` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, window_id, reason}`; `reason` is `exited` or `killed` (not sent when the whole Terminal is removed) | 21 |
| `window.selected` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, window_id, pane_id}`: the Terminal's active window changed; `pane_id` is its active pane | 21 |
| `pane.created` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, window_id, pane: Pane}` | 21 |
| `pane.removed` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, window_id, pane_id, reason}`; `reason` is `exited` or `killed`; after the pane's `pane.exited` | 21 |
| `pane.selected` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, window_id, pane_id}`: a window's active pane changed | 21 |
| `window.alert` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, window_id, pane_id, kind: "activity" \| "bell"}`: a window that is not shown had output or a bell (once until it is shown) | 25 |
| `terminal.activity` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, pane_id, kind: "output" \| "bell"}`: a Terminal had output or a bell, for the windows' background tabs; per Terminal at most every 2 s for output and every second for a bell, and again at once after any `events.subscribe`, `pane.attach` or `pane.detach` (what a window shows changed). Never saved (#98 T3) | #98 |
| `terminal.progress` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, pane_id, state: "none" \| "normal" \| "error" \| "indeterminate" \| "paused", value: 0–100}`: a pane's program reported progress with OSC 9;4 (`none`: it ended); on every change, and to a connection that subscribes to `terminals` for each progress showing. Never saved (#98 T3) | #98 |
| `terminal.command_done` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, pane_id, exit_code: int \| null, duration_ms: u64 \| null}`: a shell-integration command finished (OSC 133 `D`, timed from its `C`). Never saved (#98 T3) | #98 |
| `window.options` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, window_id, options}`: `window.set_option` changed an option | 25 |

| `terminal.claude_changed` | `terminals` | `{terminal_id, claude_state, previous}`: a Terminal's aggregate Claude state changed ([ADR 0062](../adr/0062-claude-code-status-indicators.md)); Terminal objects carry `claude_state` | 28 |
| `claude.state_changed` | `claude` | `{pane_id, terminal_id, session_id, state, previous_state, event}` ([ADR 0061](../adr/0061-claude-code-hooks-and-session-events.md)); `state` `none` when the session or its pane ended | 27 |

## 6. Error codes (stable)

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `protocol_error` | Malformed frame/JSON, limit exceeded; connection closed |
| `protocol_unsupported` | No common protocol major version |
| `unknown_request` | Method not known to, or not yet implemented by, this Host |
| `invalid_params` | Params missing/invalid; `details.field` names the field |
| `unauthorized` | Method not allowed for this client kind/capability, or a client of another user |
| `target_not_found` | No object matches the target |
| `ambiguous_target` | Several objects match; `details.candidates` lists IDs |
| `invalid_name` | Name violates ADR 0007 rules |
| `name_conflict` | Name already used (case-insensitive) |
| `busy` | Destructive operation on a busy object without `force` (`host.stop` with live Terminals and no `kill_terminals`; stopping, killing or force-removing a busy running Terminal), the connection limit, or the Terminal limit (256) |
| `spawn_failed` | Process could not start; `details.reason` (`not_found`, `access_denied`, `bad_cwd`, `not_executable` (Step 11: a script, or not a program Windows can start), `other`) |
| `invalid_state` | Operation not allowed in the object's state (e.g. remove a `running` Terminal without `force`, attach to a `stopped` one, end a `starting` one) |
| `state_from_newer_version` | Stored state was written by a newer Subak; read-only |
| `unsupported_platform` | Feature not available on this OS |
| `host_stopping` | Host is shutting down |
| `timeout` | Operation exceeded its deadline (e.g. no `hello` within 5 s) |
| `internal_error` | Bug; request failed, Host continues |

The CLI maps them to its own codes ([CLI_CONTRACT §6](../CLI_CONTRACT.md)): `invalid_params` →
`usage`, `unauthorized` → `permission_denied`, `target_not_found` → `target_not_found`, `busy` →
`confirmation_required`, `name_conflict`, `invalid_name`, `ambiguous_target`, `invalid_state` and
`spawn_failed` → the CLI codes of the same name, `host_stopping` → `host_disconnected`, `timeout` →
`timeout`,
`protocol_unsupported` → `host_too_old` / `host_too_new`, protocol errors → `protocol_error`, and
anything else → `internal`. Client-side failures have their own codes: `host_identity_mismatch`
(the server is not `subak.exe` of this user) and `host_unresponsive` (a verified Host does not
answer in time, or its pipe stays busy). A client never stops or replaces such a Host.

## 7. Compatibility rules

1. Unknown JSON fields are ignored by both sides.
2. New methods, events, fields and error codes are **additive** (minor; advertised via
   `features`).
3. Removing/renaming anything or changing semantics requires protocol major `2`; a Host may
   serve several majors.
4. Clients must handle unknown error codes as generic failures and unknown events by ignoring
   them.
5. A client never restarts a Host to resolve a version mismatch (`host_too_old`, `host_too_new`).

## 8. Host lifetime, start on demand and manual checks

- **Start on demand** (ADR 0003 §3, ADR 0019 §4): connect; if nobody serves the endpoint, take
  the named mutex `Local\mouv-subak-start-<endpoint>` (wait up to 20 s), connect again, and only
  then spawn `subak host serve` detached (ADR 0016) with the user's logon environment. Then wait
  up to 10 s for the pipe. Several starters at once give one Host: measured with 6 concurrent
  `host start` calls, which produced one Host and five `host_already_running` errors naming its
  pid.
- **Idle exit** (ADR 0003 §4): the Host exits when it has owned no live pane and no connection for
  the idle grace period (`--idle-exit`, default 10 s). Measured: 2.02 s for a 2 s grace.
- **Stale endpoints**: a crashed Host's pipe disappears with it, so the next start succeeds at once.
  A stopping Host is waited for. A hung Host is reported as `host_unresponsive` and left alone. A
  foreign holder is reported as `host_identity_mismatch`.

**Not verified headlessly** (needs a second account or elevation on the maintainer's desktop):

1. *Another Windows user cannot connect.* Create a second local user (or use an existing one).
   As the first user run `subak host start --no-shell --idle-exit 600 --endpoint subak-xuser`.
   As the second user, in `runas /user:<other> cmd`, run
   `subak host status --endpoint subak-xuser --json`. **Expected:** `permission_denied` (exit 1),
   because the DACL refuses the open; the Host's `host.stats` shows no new connection. Then stop
   the Host as the first user.
2. *Elevated Host, normal client.* Start the Host from an administrator terminal, then run
   `subak host health` from a normal one. **Expected:** `host_identity_mismatch` ("its owner
   cannot be verified"), and the Host keeps running. The reverse (normal Host, elevated client)
   is expected to work, because the Host reads the client from its connection token.

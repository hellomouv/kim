# Product Requirements

Status: **current** · Owner: mouv · Derived from [KIM_PHILOSOPHY](KIM_PHILOSOPHY.md) and
[SUBAK_PHILOSOPHY](SUBAK_PHILOSOPHY.md)

## 0. How to read this document

- **IDs** are unique and permanent: `KIM-*` for the Kim manager and all tools, `SUBAK-*` for
  Subak. `FR` = functional, `NFR` = non-functional, `SEC` = security/privacy/safety. IDs are
  never renumbered or reused; a dropped requirement is marked *withdrawn*, not deleted.
- **Priority:** `P0` must ship in its milestone (milestone blocker) · `P1` should ship in its
  milestone · `P2` long-term aspiration, tracked but not promised.
- **Milestone:** `M1` Kim Foundation · `M2` Subak MVP · `M3` Parity expansion · `M4` Linux
  (see §1).
- **Verify:** `T` automated test · `M` manual check on real Windows · `I` inspection/review ·
  `D` documentation exists and is accurate.
- Requirements marked **NON-NEGOTIABLE** may not be relaxed by any ADR, setting default,
  feature flag or test shortcut.

## 1. Milestones

| Milestone | Goal | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **M1 – Kim Foundation** | Docs and engineering standards; architecture and compatibility specs; design system; Kim tool catalog; manual installer + Kim Manager GUI; headless Kim CLI | All `P0` `KIM-*` requirements with milestone M1 pass their verification |
| **M2 – Subak MVP** | A daily-usable persistent terminal on Windows: Host/Client, ConPTY sessions, headless CLI, tabbed GUI with floating icon, restore after reboot, Claude indicator | All `P0` `SUBAK-*` M2 requirements pass, including manual Windows verification |
| **M3 – Parity expansion** | Breadth: tmux command/key/format compatibility, Tabby-class features (profiles, SSH, file transfer), MCP servers | Tracked per item in the tmux and Tabby matrices |
| **M4 – Linux** | Linux builds of Kim and Subak with tested runtime support | Linux runtime tests pass on real Linux |

The immediate MVP is **M1 + M2**. tmux and Tabby *parity* is long-term (`P2`, M3); the M2 MVP
includes only the explicitly listed basic subset (`SUBAK-FR-033`, `SUBAK-FR-035`).

## 2. Target platforms

| Platform | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 11, x86_64 | **Primary target** (M1, M2) |
| Windows 10 version 1809 or later, x86_64 (ConPTY minimum) | **Primary target** (M1, M2) |
| Windows on ARM64 | Planned, not tested, not claimed |
| Linux x86_64 (glibc) | Planned for M4. Before M4: portable *compile* checks only, no runtime claim |
| macOS | Out of scope (no plan) |

## 3. Kim requirements

### 3.1 Functional

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KIM-FR-001 | Each Kim tool is a separately versioned, separately installable native binary; no tool requires another to be installed unless it declares that dependency explicitly. | P0 | M1 | T, I |
| KIM-FR-002 | Installing Kim installs, starts and schedules **no** other tool. | P0 | M1 | T, M |
| KIM-FR-003 | Kim shows a catalog of tools with id, name, description, version, platform/arch, license and support status, readable offline from a trusted local cache or bundled catalog. | P0 | M1 | T |
| KIM-FR-004 | The catalog states per tool whether it is *installed*, *available*, *update available* or *incompatible* with this machine. | P0 | M1 | T |
| KIM-FR-005 | On explicit request, Kim installs a tool: download → verify → stage → atomic install, with accurate progress, cancellation and retry. | P0 | M1 | T, M |
| KIM-FR-006 | On explicit request, Kim uninstalls a tool (data preservation per `KIM-SEC-005`). | P0 | M1 | T, M |
| KIM-FR-007 | On explicit request, Kim updates a tool; an interrupted or failed update leaves the previous working version installed and usable. | P0 | M1 | T |
| KIM-FR-008 | Kim can check for updates and display remote version and release notes; checking never downloads or installs binaries. | P0 | M1 | T |
| KIM-FR-009 | A small native Kim Manager GUI shows available vs installed tools, details, versions, progress, completion and errors, with explicit Install / Uninstall / Update buttons. | P1 | M1 | M |
| KIM-FR-010 | Every Kim capability is available from the CLI, with human-readable output and `--json` machine-readable output. | P0 | M1 | T |
| KIM-FR-011 | The CLI follows one contract across tools: discoverable `--help`, data on stdout and diagnostics on stderr, documented exit codes, stable structured error codes, `--quiet`/`--verbose`, `--dry-run` for state-changing commands, and no interactive prompts when non-interactive. | P0 | M1 | T, D |
| KIM-FR-012 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Headless/CLI/agent paths never open a GUI window, tray icon, browser or interactive prompt. | P0 | M1 | T, I |
| KIM-FR-013 | Every state-changing GUI operation has an equivalent CLI command, and vice versa. | P1 | M1 | I |
| KIM-FR-020 | Installed tools are discoverable with their capabilities, and tools can invoke one another through documented CLI/JSON contracts — without a permanently running central orchestrator. | P1 | M1 | T, D |
| KIM-FR-021 | A tool may additionally expose a local, opt-in MCP server; MCP is never the only interface. | P2 | M3 | T, D |
| KIM-FR-034 | Updating or uninstalling a tool that is running (e.g. a Subak Host with live Terminals) never terminates it silently: Kim reports it and the user chooses to defer or to stop it. | P0 | M1 | T |
| KIM-FR-050 | The catalog can describe each tool beyond its releases, additively and signed with it: feature summary, how the program runs (e.g. a tray utility), GUI / headless CLI / MCP entry points, documentation and MCP links, a summary of its default shortcuts (from its hotkey manifest) and the permissions it needs. Kim shows them in `kim catalog show` and Kim Manager, and adds what a catalog cannot decide: the per-user install and data locations and the manual-only install, update and uninstall commands. | P1 | M1 | T, D |
| KIM-FR-051 | **Release availability is derived, never declared.** Kim shows each tool as *planned* (no release), *preview* (preview releases only) or *available* (a stable release exists), from the signed releases alone. A tool is never offered for download without a signed, hashed release for this OS and architecture; installing a planned tool fails with `no_release` and says that it is planned. | P0 | M1 | T |
| KIM-FR-052 | For an installed tool, the shortcuts Kim shows come from the tool's installed hotkey manifest and the user's `hotkeys.json` (read-only, the discovery rules of the hotkey contract), not from the catalog; without a usable installed manifest Kim shows the catalog's defaults and says why. | P1 | M1 | T |
| KIM-FR-060 | **One-step installation.** A user gets from a trusted download to a running Kim Manager with one action: on Windows one installer (`Kim-Setup.exe`, per-user, no administrator rights, no network, integrity-checked before anything runs, Start Menu entry, Apps & Features uninstall keeping user data); on Linux one package or one reviewable command (planned). It installs only Kim, never another tool, service or autostart. | P0 | M1 | T, D |

### 3.2 Non-functional

Budgets are initial targets; Step 03 defines how each is measured, and a budget may only be
changed by an ADR with measurements.

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KIM-NFR-001 | **Idle CPU.** Kim CLI commands exit when done (no residency). A long-running Kim process with no activity averages < 0.1 % of one core over 60 s and does not poll faster than needed. | P0 | M1 | T, M |
| KIM-NFR-002 | **Memory.** Kim CLI peak working set < 30 MB for catalog operations; Kim Manager GUI idle < 80 MB. | P1 | M1 | M |
| KIM-NFR-003 | **Disk.** Kim CLI binary ≤ 15 MB; no writes while idle; logs capped (default 10 MB per tool). | P1 | M1 | M |
| KIM-NFR-004 | **Network.** Zero network connections unless the user invoked an operation that needs the network or enabled update checks. | P0 | M1 | T, I |
| KIM-NFR-005 | **Latency.** `kim catalog list` from cache completes in < 200 ms on a typical machine. | P1 | M1 | M |
| KIM-NFR-010 | Runs on the primary Windows targets in §2. | P0 | M1 | M |
| KIM-NFR-011 | OS-specific code sits behind narrow portable interfaces; Linux runtime support is not claimed before M4. | P0 | M1 | I |
| KIM-NFR-012 | **Accessibility.** Every GUI function is keyboard-operable with visible focus; text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (WCAG AA); honors system reduced-motion and per-monitor DPI scaling. | P1 | M1 | M |
| KIM-NFR-013 | **Unicode.** CLI I/O is UTF-8; GUIs render Korean/CJK and fall back to system fonts for missing glyphs. | P0 | M1 | T, M |
| KIM-NFR-014 | **Contract stability.** CLI JSON output, IPC messages and stored state carry schema versions; breaking changes require a new major schema version plus migration/compatibility notes. | P0 | M1 | T, D |

### 3.3 Security, privacy and safety

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KIM-SEC-001 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Kim never installs, updates or removes any tool without an explicit user action naming that operation (GUI button press or CLI command). No background, scheduled, on-launch or "silent" install/update exists. | P0 | M1 | T, I |
| KIM-SEC-002 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Update checks are optional and display-only, honor the offline/privacy setting, and are **off by default** at launch; `kim update check` remains available on demand. | P0 | M1 | T |
| KIM-SEC-003 | Every downloaded artifact is verified (SHA-256 and signature against a trusted key) before staging; any failure aborts with no change to installed state. | P0 | M1 | T |
| KIM-SEC-004 | Per-user installs by default; never elevate silently; elevation only on explicit request with an explanation. | P0 | M1 | T, I |
| KIM-SEC-005 | Uninstall preserves user data and configuration unless the user separately and explicitly confirms deleting it. | P0 | M1 | T |
| KIM-SEC-006 | Before an install or update, Kim discloses what the tool declares it does that matters for security (e.g. registers global hotkeys, captures the screen, installs a keyboard hook, injects input, starts programs; opt-in ones marked) and its declared dependencies, in the CLI plan and in Kim Manager. Disclosure never replaces consent: the install still starts only from the user's explicit action, and no dependency is installed implicitly. | P0 | M1 | T, I |
| KIM-SEC-010 | No account, sign-in or cloud service is required for any functionality. | P0 | M1 | I |
| KIM-SEC-011 | No ads and no tracking. | P0 | M1 | I |
| KIM-SEC-012 | Telemetry is off by default. Diagnostics stay local, never contain terminal content, command lines, file paths, environment values or user names, and leave the machine only through an explicit user export. | P0 | M1 | I, T |
| KIM-SEC-013 | Secrets (tokens, passwords, keys, values marked secret) never appear in logs, JSON output, crash reports or plaintext state. | P0 | M1 | T, I |
| KIM-SEC-014 | A documented process exists for privately reporting security issues. | P0 | M1 | D |

### 3.4 Keyboard shortcuts (every Kim tool with a GUI)

These apply to every installable Kim tool that has a GUI: Kim Manager, Subak's GUI, and later
tools such as Noeul and Ddalgak. A tool without a GUI needs no shortcuts, and CLI commands do
not need hotkeys of their own. Milestone M2 below means that Kim Manager and Subak conform by
the end of M2; a tool added later conforms in its first release that has a GUI. The rules are
specified in [HOTKEY_CONTRACT.md](HOTKEY_CONTRACT.md) ([ADR 0017](adr/0017-universal-customizable-hotkeys.md)).

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KIM-FR-040 | A cross-tool hotkey contract (v1) defines action IDs, scopes, the chord and sequence syntax, the stored configuration and its migrations, the `hotkeys` CLI, conflict and precedence rules, and safety rules. JSON schemas and conflict fixtures make it machine-checkable. | P0 | M1 | D, T |
| KIM-FR-041 | **Discoverable.** Every GUI tool lists all of its bindable actions with their current binding, scope and state (default, user-set, disabled, unbound, in conflict) inside the GUI, reachable by keyboard, and `<tool> hotkeys list --json` returns the same list. | P1 | M2 | T, M |
| KIM-FR-042 | **Defaults where appropriate.** Defaults exist only for frequent actions. A system-wide (global) default is limited to a tool's primary entry action, and never uses a reserved chord or another Kim tool's global default. | P1 | M2 | T, I |
| KIM-FR-043 | **Editable.** The user can rebind every bindable action, in the GUI by keyboard-only capture and with `<tool> hotkeys set`, without reinstalling or restarting the tool. Only the contract's reserved navigation and recovery keys cannot be rebound. | P1 | M2 | T, M |
| KIM-FR-044 | **Disable and reset.** Each binding can be disabled on its own, bindings can be reset per action or all at once, and a tool-wide switch turns all of a tool's shortcuts off (global registrations are released at once). User choices survive updates; a changed default never overwrites a user binding. | P1 | M2 | T |
| KIM-FR-045 | **Headless.** The `<tool> hotkeys` commands (`list`, `show`, `set`, `disable`, `enable`, `reset`, `check`) follow the CLI contract (`--json`, `--dry-run`, exit codes, registered error codes). They never open a window, register a hotkey or install a hook. | P1 | M2 | T |
| KIM-FR-046 | **Conflicts are reported, never resolved silently.** Conflicts inside a tool, between installed Kim tools (found by read-only discovery, without a daemon), with reserved chords, and at registration with keys that other programs own are reported with stable codes and a non-destructive remap offer. Nothing changes until the user chooses. | P1 | M2 | T |
| KIM-NFR-020 | **No shared hook or daemon.** Shortcut support adds no process. Each tool handles its own keys only while it runs, registers global hotkeys only while it runs and they are enabled, and adds no idle wake-ups or polling. | P0 | M2 | T, I |
| KIM-NFR-021 | **Accessible binding editor and IME safety.** Capture and editing work by keyboard alone, never trap focus, announce the captured chord to screen readers and never fire the action being captured. No shortcut fires during an IME composition, and IME mode keys are never bound. | P1 | M2 | T, M |
| KIM-NFR-022 | **Portable bindings.** Stored bindings use the contract's key names (logical, physical or character), never bare Windows virtual-key numbers, so a Linux backend can read the same file. Linux runtime support is still not claimed before M4. | P1 | M2 | T, I |
| KIM-SEC-020 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE.** A Kim tool never steals a shortcut by force. It does not unregister, hook around or override a chord that the OS reserves or that another program owns. A failed registration is reported, and the binding stays inactive until the user changes it. | P0 | M2 | T, I |
| KIM-SEC-021 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE.** No Kim tool intercepts, observes or injects keys on the secure desktop (Ctrl+Alt+Del / Secure Attention Sequence, UAC consent, sign-in and lock screen) or in password fields. Shortcut capture never records text typed into a password field. | P0 | M2 | I, T, M |
| KIM-SEC-022 | **No keylogging.** Shortcut handling acts only on bound chords. It never logs, stores or transmits other keystrokes, and diagnostics name action IDs, not typed keys. A system-wide keyboard hook is allowed only in a tool whose purpose needs one (Ddalgak), only after the user enabled it, and visibly. | P0 | M2 | I, T |
| KIM-SEC-023 | **Emergency recovery.** Every tool with global shortcuts can start with all shortcuts off (`--no-hotkeys`, `KIM_NO_HOTKEYS`) and can turn them off from the CLI while running. An unreadable or invalid configuration never registers global shortcuts and never crashes the tool. A tool with a keyboard hook also keeps one non-remappable emergency chord that switches the hook off. | P0 | M2 | T, M |

## 4. Subak requirements

### 4.1 Host, Client and object model

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SUBAK-FR-001 | A per-user Host process owns all Terminals, pseudo-consoles, process trees, scrollback and session state. Only the Host starts, signals or kills terminal processes. | P0 | M2 | T, I |
| SUBAK-FR-002 | The Host starts on demand and runs only while it owns ≥ 1 live Terminal or a client is attached; starting at login happens only if the user enabled it. | P0 | M2 | T |
| SUBAK-FR-003 | A client closing, detaching, crashing or being killed never affects processes in the Host. | P0 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-004 | Multiple clients (GUI, CLI, agents) can be attached at the same time and observe consistent state. | P1 | M2 | T |
| SUBAK-FR-010 | Hierarchy Terminal → Window → Pane → process; every object has a stable, never-reused ID and an editable name; CLI and GUI use the same IDs. | P0 | M2 | T |
| SUBAK-FR-018 | **Splits and layout.** Each internal window is split horizontally and vertically into panes (nested, equal at first) by a layout the Host owns; panes are resized, focused by direction, swapped, zoomed and closed without ending any other process, and every pane's pseudo console has exactly its share of the window (the latest client's size); the layout survives client detach and reconnect, is the same for CLI, IPC and GUI, and the GUI draws every visible pane and is keyboard accessible ([SESSION_MODEL §3](SESSION_MODEL.md), ADR 0056). | P0 | M3 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-016 | Pane processes run under Windows ConPTY; each pane's process tree is contained (e.g. Job Object) so ending a pane ends all its descendants. | P0 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-017 | **Internal windows and panes.** A Terminal holds several internal windows (not GUI tabs), each with several panes whose processes run independently under the Host; windows and panes are created, listed, selected, renamed (windows) and ended through versioned IPC and equivalent CLI commands with tmux-style indexes and `<terminal>:<window>.<pane>` targets; the selection is the Host's, the same for every client; each command acts on exactly one level, so none ends a whole Terminal or reaches another Terminal's window or pane; ending a window or pane ends only its own processes ([SESSION_MODEL](SESSION_MODEL.md), ADR 0054). | P0 | M2 | T |

### 4.2 Terminal CRUD, attach and detach

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SUBAK-FR-011 | **Create** a Terminal from a profile (shell, cwd, env, title) via GUI `Ctrl+T` and CLI. | P0 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-012 | **Read**: list Terminals/Windows/Panes with state and Claude status (human and JSON); capture pane text. | P0 | M2 | T |
| SUBAK-FR-013 | **Update**: rename; send input/keys; create/close Windows and Panes; resize. | P0 | M2 | T |
| SUBAK-FR-014 | **Delete**: kill a Terminal and its process trees, only on explicit request; the GUI confirms when any pane runs more than an idle shell; the CLI supports `--dry-run` and refuses busy Terminals without `--force` when non-interactive. | P0 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-015 | Attach/detach from CLI and GUI without affecting processes; closing the GUI window is a detach. | P0 | M2 | T, M |

### 4.3 GUI

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SUBAK-FR-030 | Optional tiny floating icon (or tray icon) showing aggregate status and opening the GUI; can be disabled. | P1 | M2 | M |
| SUBAK-FR-031 | Native tabbed GUI (one tab per Terminal) using the Kim design system, with correct Korean/CJK rendering. No Electron or embedded browser. | P0 | M2 | M, I |
| SUBAK-FR-032 | Session manager listing every Terminal in the Host, including ones not open as tabs. | P1 | M2 | M |
| SUBAK-FR-033 | Default keys: `Ctrl+T` new, `Ctrl+W` close (= delete, confirmed when busy), `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` next/previous tab, `Ctrl+B` prefix with the basic table `c n p 0-9 % " arrows x & z d , $` and `Ctrl+B Ctrl+B` for a literal `Ctrl+B`. | P0 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-034 | Every GUI shortcut is rebindable, and a shadowed key (e.g. `Ctrl+W`) can be passed through to the program. | P1 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-035 | Split panes and switch windows in the GUI. | P1 | M2 | M |
| SUBAK-FR-036 | **Faithful terminal emulation.** The Host and every client view interpret pane output with one shared model: the xterm subset of escape sequences, cursor operations, the alternate screen, scroll regions, UTF-8 with East Asian wide characters, Korean, emoji and combining marks, 16/256/24-bit colour, OSC 8 hyperlinks, mouse reporting, bracketed paste, focus events and resize; checked by conformance fixtures and by real ConPTY output rendered against golden screens ([TERMINAL_EMULATOR](TERMINAL_EMULATOR.md)). | P0 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-037 | **The Subak window.** A native window (`subak-gui`, no Electron, browser or GPU stack) shows one existing Terminal's pane live through the Host's IPC as an interactive client: it starts a Host on demand without starting a shell, never creates, ends or duplicates a Terminal by opening or closing, handles keyboard, IME (Korean composition drawn inline), focus, per-monitor DPI, minimize and maximize, shows clear loading, empty, chooser, error and disconnected states, reconnects without starting a Host, and keeps its display preferences and placement in its own file ([SUBAK_GUI](SUBAK_GUI.md)). | P0 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-038 | **Window tabs and safe close.** The Subak window shows the Host's Terminals as tabs (state in shape and words, name, the shown one, a close `×` that only hides the tab, rename in place, ordering) that follow every client's create, rename, stop and kill; `Ctrl+T` creates, `Ctrl+Tab`/`Ctrl+Shift+Tab` switch, `Ctrl+W` ends the shown Terminal by id and asks first when the Host reports it busy (the safe answer is the default), or removes a stored one; the window's close button only detaches; every key is a rebindable action of the hotkey contract and a key that is not a shortcut reaches the program ([SUBAK_GUI §2](SUBAK_GUI.md), ADR 0042). | P0 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-039 | **Floating icon, tray and Terminal manager.** An optional floating icon (a small always-on-top, draggable tool window that never takes the focus) and/or tray icon, off unless the user starts it and never needed by the Host or the CLI, opens a compact Terminal manager listing every Terminal of the Host with its state, with quick search, open (an existing window shows it, else a new one; the foreground is handed on explicitly), create, rename and delete — delete always asks, names what ends, ends by id and sends `force` only for what the question named busy. It never starts a Host by itself (only New Terminal does), keeps its place per monitor and DPI and brings itself back when its monitor disappears, exposes its controls to assistive technology with names, is usable by keyboard, mouse and touch, and closing it or the manager ends nothing ([SUBAK_GUI §11](SUBAK_GUI.md), ADR 0045). | P1 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-047 | **Search, selection, clipboard and links in the window.** The Subak window searches the pane's retained output (the history and screen the Host keeps, including output printed while no window was attached) incrementally, as literal text or a regular expression with case and whole-word options, with bounded complexity and time and no copy into GPU memory; selects by mouse and keyboard (mark mode) and selects all; copies plain text and optionally HTML with colours; pastes plain text only (optionally as one line); opens and copies OSC 8 hyperlinks and detected web addresses after validation; and saves the output to a file only on request. The Host and the CLI do not depend on these GUI components ([SUBAK_GUI §12](SUBAK_GUI.md), ADR 0048). | P1 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-048 | **Settings and appearance.** The window's look and behaviour are user settings in a versioned, human-edited `config.toml` (`config_version`): themes from the design tokens (`kim-dark`, `kim-light`, following Windows' light or dark mode, High Contrast), the terminal font family (with the design system's fallback chain), text size, line height, padding, window opacity, motion (calm transitions; none under reduced motion, whether Windows' or the setting's), copy on select, smart `Ctrl+C`, the right- and middle-click actions and word separators. The window applies them at once and when it regains the focus, and offers them in a keyboard-accessible native menu; `subak config` (`show`, `check`, `set`, `reset`, `export`, `import`) does the same headlessly. An invalid value falls back alone and is named with its key and line; an invalid or newer file is never rewritten by an edit; bulk changes and migrations keep a backup; settings never change a running Terminal ([SUBAK_GUI §13](SUBAK_GUI.md), ADR 0051). | P1 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-049 | **Basic local shell profiles.** `config.toml` defines named profiles (program, arguments, absolute working directory, environment variables to set or remove) and a default one; `Ctrl+T`, the window's menu and `subak new --profile` start them, the client sending the explicit command, folder and environment (the Host never reads profiles); values given on the command line win. Subak never writes a secret-looking value into a profile and shows every secret-looking value as `***` (`subak profile list`, `show`). SSH, serial and other profile kinds are Step 33 ([SUBAK_GUI §13](SUBAK_GUI.md), ADR 0051). | P1 | M2 | T, M |

### 4.4 Persistence, restore and Claude resume

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SUBAK-FR-040 | Persist structure, names, layout, cwd, profile and non-secret environment on change, atomically. | P0 | M2 | T |
| SUBAK-FR-041 | After reboot, logoff or Host crash, offer to restore the structure with new processes; restored objects are marked `restored`. | P0 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-042 | Optional (off by default) scrollback persistence, shown after restore as read-only history separated from new output. | P1 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-043 | A restored pane is never presented as the original process. | P0 | M2 | I, M |
| SUBAK-FR-044 | Sleep, hibernate, lock and Remote Desktop disconnect never trigger restore or create duplicate Terminals. | P0 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-045 | Opt-in Claude resume: on restore, a pane that ran Claude Code with a known session ID runs `claude --resume <id>`. | P1 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-FR-046 | Configuration is human-readable and versioned; unknown keys are preserved; an invalid config falls back to defaults with a clear error, never a crash. | P0 | M2 | T |

### 4.5 Claude status indicator

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SUBAK-FR-050 | Each pane running Claude Code has one of five states — `idle`, `in-progress`, `need-input`, `error`, `done` (unseen completion; becomes `idle` when viewed) — or `unknown` when evidence is missing or stale; panes without Claude are `none`. | P1 | M2 | T |
| SUBAK-FR-051 | States aggregate to Window, tab, session manager and floating icon with priority `need-input` > `error` > `done` > `in-progress` > `unknown` > `idle` > `none`, each with a text label (not color alone). | P1 | M2 | T |
| SUBAK-FR-052 | State detection is local and never stores or transmits conversation content. | P0 | M2 | I |
| SUBAK-FR-053 | Claude state is queryable through the CLI as JSON. | P1 | M2 | T |
| SUBAK-FR-054 | Subak has its own icon — a watermelon with a near-black rind and red flesh — readable at 16–48 px on dark and light surfaces, with monochrome/High Contrast variants and reproducible assets. Each Terminal's Claude state has a tiny distinct motion on its tab and the floating icon (in-progress turns, need-input, error and done give a short cue, idle and unknown are still), drawn only while shown, static under reduced motion or `terminal.claude_animation = false`, never animated by the Host. | P1 | M2 | T |

### 4.6 Long-term parity and platforms

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SUBAK-FR-060 | Aspire to full tmux compatibility (session/window/pane commands, key table, `send-keys`, `capture-pane`, format strings); each item tracked as implemented/planned/unsupported with evidence. | P2 | M3 | D, T |
| SUBAK-FR-061 | Aspire to Tabby functional parity (profiles, SSH, file transfer, themes, search); tracked per feature with evidence. | P2 | M3 | D, T |
| SUBAK-FR-062 | Optional local MCP server for Subak (list, create, send keys, capture, Claude state). | P2 | M3 | T |
| SUBAK-FR-070 | Linux Host and Clients. | P2 | M4 | T, M |

### 4.7 Security and safety

| SUBAK-SEC-001 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Recovery never kills, replaces or duplicates a live session. If a Host is running, restore is not offered for Terminals it still owns. | P0 | M2 | T |
| SUBAK-SEC-002 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Restore never re-runs arbitrary commands automatically; only per-pane opt-in restart commands and opt-in Claude resume are executed. | P0 | M2 | T, I |
| SUBAK-SEC-003 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE.** State writes are atomic; a backup is taken before any migration or restore; a failed restore leaves the previous state intact. | P0 | M2 | T |
| SUBAK-SEC-010 | Client–Host IPC is local and restricted to the same user; no network listener by default. | P0 | M2 | T, I |
| SUBAK-SEC-011 | Persisted state and scrollback are stored with user-only permissions; variables marked secret are not persisted. | P0 | M2 | T, I |
| SUBAK-SEC-012 | Remote/agent input injection is limited to the same user through the local IPC; any remote control requires explicit enablement. | P0 | M2 | T, I |
| SUBAK-SEC-013 | **Terminal output never makes a client act on its own.** Hyperlinks open only on an explicit user action that shows the target; clipboard writes from programs (OSC 52) are not honoured without opt-in and never replayed; device reports are answered by one client only, bounded; pasted text loses control characters so it cannot end a bracketed paste or inject escape sequences. | P0 | M2 | T, I |
| SUBAK-SEC-014 | **Acting on terminal content asks first.** A paste that would run lines without bracketed paste, carries control characters (always removed) or is large is confirmed first; a link opens only for an allowed scheme (`http`, `https` by default) without credentials or control characters, through the OS "open" handler and never a shell command line, and a hyperlink whose text may differ from its target shows the target first; saving output to a file happens only on an explicit request whose question reports the secret-looking values found (hidden by default choice), and only to the path the user chose; no output is ever sent to a network service. In every such question the safe answer is the default. | P0 | M2 | T, M |

### 4.8 Non-functional

| SUBAK-NFR-001 | **Terminal view cost.** A client view keeps up with ConPTY output while drawing, draws only rows that changed, adds no timer, thread or GPU context while idle (0 CPU over 60 s with no output), and its keyboard path adds well under one frame (16 ms) to the program's own echo; measured by the documented benchmark harness ([TERMINAL_EMULATOR §7](TERMINAL_EMULATOR.md)). | P1 | M2 | T, M |
| SUBAK-NFR-002 | **Window cost.** The Subak window idles at 0 CPU (no timer while connected and quiet) and within the same order of memory as the terminal view alone (a few MiB private, measured against the Step 15 renderer probe), and never holds a GPU context ([SUBAK_GUI §7](SUBAK_GUI.md)). | P1 | M2 | T, M |

## 5. Data privacy and safety policies

1. **Local-first.** All data (catalog cache, configuration, session state, scrollback, logs)
   stays on the user's machine in per-user locations.
2. **Network.** The only network operations are: catalog refresh, update check, and downloads
   for an install/update the user requested — each initiated or enabled by the user.
   (`KIM-NFR-004`, `KIM-SEC-002`)
3. **No collection.** No telemetry, analytics, crash upload, account or advertising ID.
   (`KIM-SEC-010…012`)
4. **Secrets.** Never logged, never in JSON, never persisted in plaintext.
   (`KIM-SEC-013`, `SUBAK-SEC-011`)
5. **Consent for change.** Installing, updating, uninstalling, deleting user data, killing a
   Terminal, and re-running commands on restore each require an explicit user action.
   (`KIM-SEC-001`, `KIM-SEC-005`, `SUBAK-FR-014`, `SUBAK-SEC-002`)
6. **Non-destructive recovery.** Recovery is additive and reversible. (`SUBAK-SEC-001…003`)

## 6. Out of scope for M1 (Kim Foundation)

- Any Subak runtime functionality: Host, ConPTY, terminal GUI, floating icon, restore,
  Claude indicator (all M2).
- tmux/Tabby parity work and MCP servers (M3).
- Linux runtime support (M4); macOS entirely.
- Automatic or background updates of any kind (never in scope).
- Accounts, cloud sync, plugin marketplaces, paid features.
- Authenticode code-signing certificate procurement (artifact signatures for the catalog are in
  scope via `KIM-SEC-003`).

# Ddalgak safety: risks, scope and policies

Status: **current** (Step 65, specification; Step 66 ran the engine checks it owns on real
Windows, Step 68 the remap checks, Step 69 the typing checks, Step 70 the launch checks, Step 71
the mouse checks, Step 72 the mode checks, Step 73 the enable, disable and recovery checks, §11) · Requirements: `DDALGAK-SEC-001…014`, `DDALGAK-NFR-002`, `DDALGAK-NFR-006`,
`DDALGAK-NFR-009`, `KIM-SEC-020…023` · Decisions: [ADR 0022](adr/0022-ddalgak-rule-model-and-safety.md), [ADR 0037](adr/0037-ddalgak-program-and-website-launches.md), [ADR 0040](adr/0040-ddalgak-mouse-actions.md), [ADR 0043](adr/0043-ddalgak-modes-layers-and-runtime-mode-state.md), [ADR 0046](adr/0046-ddalgak-enable-disable-and-recovery.md)

A keyboard hook sees every key, and an injector can type into any window the user can reach.
This document fixes what Ddalgak may and may not do with that power, what the operating system
prevents anyway, and who verifies each claim on real Windows. Windows behavior from Microsoft
documentation is marked *documented*; the sources are listed in
[DDALGAK_AHK_MATRIX](DDALGAK_AHK_MATRIX.md#sources-and-method) (M1–M3) and in the
[hotkey contract](HOTKEY_CONTRACT.md).

## 1. Scope and trust boundary

| Ddalgak does | Ddalgak never does |
| --- | --- |
| Run as the signed-in user, without elevation, inside `ddalgak-gui.exe` that the user started (or opt-in start at sign-in) | Install a service, driver, scheduled task, `UIAccess` binary, SYSTEM or elevated component |
| Install one low-level keyboard hook (`WH_KEYBOARD_LL`) while the engine is on, and (since Step 68) a low-level mouse hook only while the engine is on and an active rule has a mouse-button trigger (permission `mouse-hook`; the catalog disclosure is listed in [ADR 0031](adr/0031-ddalgak-remap-execution-and-mouse-hook.md)) | Hook into other processes (no DLL injection), read other programs' memory, or use kernel input filters |
| Inject keyboard and mouse input with `SendInput` when the user's rule says so and the user consented | Inject on the secure desktop, into password fields, or into elevated windows by any workaround |
| Start programs (`CreateProcessW` with a quoted argument list, Step 70) and hand `http(s)` links to the browser through the shell's `open`, as the user | Run shell strings, scripts or elevated programs (`ERROR_ELEVATION_REQUIRED` is reported, never retried elevated); hand `file:`, `javascript:`, `ms-*:` or custom-protocol links to the shell; start a program hidden; open network connections itself |
| Keep rules, history and an optional outcome list in the user's profile | Keep, log or transmit keystrokes, typed text, clipboard contents, window titles or URLs |

**Trust boundary.** Like every Kim tool, Ddalgak trusts code running as the same user at medium
integrity (see `R-09` in [RISK_REGISTER](RISK_REGISTER.md)): such code could edit `rules.json`
and its consent records. Ddalgak does not pretend otherwise. It limits the damage instead: rules
are declarative (no code to execute), launches are restricted to `.exe` files with argument
lists, shell hosts are refused, and the engine never turns itself on. The local IPC used by the
CLI follows the identity checks of [ADR 0005](adr/0005-local-ipc.md)/[ADR 0019](adr/0019-secure-host-supervisor-and-ipc-v1.md)
(Step 66 decides the details).

## 2. OS-reserved and Kim-reserved shortcuts

- **Triggers never use reserved chords** (`DDALGAK-SEC-009`, RULE_MODEL §3.1): the Secure
  Attention Sequence (`Ctrl+Alt+Delete`, also with `NumpadDecimal`), every `Win` chord,
  `Ctrl+Shift+Escape` (Task Manager, the user's way out), `Ctrl+Escape`, `Alt+Tab` and
  `Alt+Escape` variants, `Alt+Shift+PrintScreen` (High Contrast), `Alt+F4`, the IME mode keys,
  global `F12` and the emergency chord. The schema rejects them (`schema-check` proves it with
  invalid examples).
- **Widened remaps never capture them**: with `Tab` remapped, `Alt+Tab` still switches windows,
  and no `Win` chord is captured through a remapped lock key or mouse button (RULE_MODEL §3.2;
  tested in the core, Step 68).
- **The primary and secondary mouse buttons are never triggers** (Step 68): no rule can take away
  clicking. Only the middle and X buttons can be remapped or blocked.
- **Outputs never produce** the Secure Attention Sequence (Windows does not let programs
  synthesize it; *documented* for AutoHotkey's `Send`) or the emergency chord. Other chords,
  including `Win` chords such as `Win+D`, may be sent: sending them is what the user's own keys
  could do.
- **Accessibility gestures** (Sticky Keys by pressing Shift five times, Filter Keys by holding
  right Shift, Narrator, Magnifier) are never intercepted or swallowed (HOTKEY_CONTRACT §12.3).
  A rule on a bare `RShift` with `on: release` fires on a tap but lets the hold through.
- **Other programs' global hotkeys** are passed on unless a rule explicitly uses that chord
  (`KIM-SEC-020`); `kim hotkeys check --all-tools` reports such overlaps with Kim tools as
  `hook_overrides_global`.
- **Win chords as triggers** (`Win+N` to open a program, a popular AutoHotkey use) are not in
  v1. Allowing selected ones needs a hotkey contract revision and an ADR; `Win+L` and other
  shell-owned chords would stay reserved in any case.

## 3. Administrator and elevated windows (UIPI)

- Windows lets a program inject input only into windows at an equal or lower integrity level;
  `SendInput` blocked this way fails **without** an error code that says so (*documented*, M2).
  Keys typed into an elevated window are not delivered to a non-elevated low-level hook either
  (UIPI, *documented*, HOTKEY_CONTRACT §12.1).
- Ddalgak therefore checks the foreground window's process integrity before running an
  injecting rule. If it is higher than Ddalgak's, the rule is skipped with
  `skipped_elevated_target` and the key passes unchanged; the activity list and, once per
  session, a quiet notice explain it ("Ddalgak can't type into administrator windows").
  Non-injecting rules (open a program, switch mode, pause) still run.
- **No workaround**: no elevation, no `UIAccess` (which AutoHotkey offers through signed copies
  in Program Files), no service (`DDALGAK-SEC-007`, `KIM-SEC-004`). Running Ddalgak itself
  elevated is not supported: the app refuses to turn the engine on when started elevated and
  says why, because an elevated hook and injector would reach every window.

## 4. Engine lifecycle

- **Off by default.** Each start leaves the engine `off` unless the user chose
  `engine_on_start: on` (`DDALGAK-FR-003`).
- **Crash and emergency.** The app writes a small run marker while the engine is on and removes
  it on a clean stop. If the marker is present at start (crash, power loss, killed process), or
  the last stop was an emergency off, the engine stays off and the app says why. A broken rule
  that crashed the engine can therefore never crash it again on the next start. Since Step 73
  that start also releases the keys Ddalgak could have pressed that Windows still considers
  pressed (a killed process cannot release them itself; ADR 0046).
- **Session events.** On session lock, a switch to the secure desktop, sign-out and shutdown,
  held keys and buttons are released and running rules are cancelled; the hook stays installed
  while locked but no rule fires until the user's desktop is back. Sleep and resume are treated
  like lock and unlock. A lock never changes the engine state (Step 73): an unlock therefore never
  resumes anything the user paused. Sign-out stops the engine cleanly.
- **Invalid configuration** never turns the engine on, and never crashes it (`KIM-SEC-023`).
- **Never silently re-enabled.** Not after a crash, a reboot, an update, an import or a
  configuration change. Since Step 73 the user's own turn-off (tray, CLI, shortcut, rule) is
  remembered: the next start stays off, even with `engine_on_start: on`, until the user turns the
  engine on. Profiles and modes can be disabled in `rules.json` (`enabled: false`); only the user
  turns them on again.
- **A lost hook turns the engine off** (Step 73): a hook callback that takes as long as
  `LowLevelHooksTimeout`, after which Windows removes the hook silently (*documented*), makes the
  engine turn itself off, release everything and say so (§7).

## 5. Keyboard layouts and IME (Korean first)

- **Key identity** follows HOTKEY_CONTRACT §6: logical letters follow the layout's virtual keys
  (on Korean 2-set, `Ctrl+Z` is the key with ㅋ), `code:` keys follow the physical position,
  and stored rules never contain virtual-key numbers (`DDALGAK-NFR-005`).
- **Composition guard.** While an IME composition is active, no rule fires; the keys belong to
  the IME. Ddalgak never commits or cancels a composition (`skipped_ime_composition`).
- **IME mode keys** (`HangulMode` 한/영, `Hanja` 한자, `code:Lang1`–`code:Lang5`, …) are never
  triggers, but may be remap **outputs**: Right Alt acting as 한/영 on a US-layout keyboard is
  one of the most common Korean remaps (example `01-remap.json`). Whether the Korean IME accepts
  an injected `VK_HANGUL` is **not tested** yet: Step 68 ships the output and lists it as a manual
  check (DDALGAK_ENGINE §11, check 5); automated tests may not drive the IME on this machine.
- **Typed text** uses Unicode key events (`KEYEVENTF_UNICODE`), so Hangul syllables, emoji and
  characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane arrive independent of the active layout and
  IME mode. Applications that ignore Unicode key events get the `paste` method. A run never starts
  during an IME composition, and hotstrings never fire while the IME is in a native mode such as
  Hangul (read from the focused window's IME window; Step 69).
- **Hotstrings translate keys without side effects.** The hook asks the focused window's layout
  what a key types with `ToUnicodeEx` and its "keyboard state is not changed" flag (Windows 10
  1607 and later, *documented*), only while a hotstring rule exists and only for keys that reach
  the application unchanged; a dead key clears the buffer ([ADR 0034](adr/0034-ddalgak-typing-runs-hotstrings-and-clipboard.md)).
- **AltGr layouts.** `Ctrl+Alt+<key>` triggers get `altgr_collision` warnings; on such layouts
  Windows reports AltGr as `LCtrl+RAlt` (*documented*).
- **Dead keys.** Ddalgak never translates keys to characters inside the hook (no `char:`
  triggers), because doing so disturbs the dead-key state of the focused application.
- **Layout switches** change nothing in `rules.json`; logical rules keep their meaning, physical
  rules keep their position.

## 6. Anti-cheat and games

- Many games read input through paths that ignore synthesized input, and anti-cheat systems may
  detect or forbid low-level hooks and injected input; the AutoHotkey FAQ notes that games with
  anti-cheat are likely to block it (*documented*, F). Using such tools can break a game's terms
  of service.
- Ddalgak **never hides** (no process renaming, no hook concealment), **never evades or bypasses**
  anti-cheat or input protection, and installs no kernel component or virtual input device
  (`DDALGAK-SEC-012`). It makes no promise that rules work in any game.
- Users can keep a near-empty "Gaming" profile, pause rules with one key, or turn the engine off
  so that no hook exists. Step 82 documents tested behavior with a few common non-protected games
  and states plainly that protected games are out of scope.

## 7. Global hook security and emergency disable

- **One hook, short callback.** The hook callback copies the event into a lock-free queue,
  decides synchronously only whether the event is consumed (using precomputed trigger tables),
  and returns in well under 1 ms (`DDALGAK-NFR-002`). Running steps, reading window
  information and launching programs happen on worker threads. Windows removes a hook that
  exceeds `LowLevelHooksTimeout` (at most 1000 ms on Windows 10 1709 and later), silently on
  Windows 7 and later (*documented*, M1); Ddalgak treats getting anywhere near that as a bug and
  never relies on it as a safety net.
- **Hook health.** Windows gives no notice when it removes a hook (*documented*). Step 66
  designs an on-demand health check, run when the editor opens or `ddalgak status` runs and
  never on a timer, that reports a removed hook and offers to reinstall it. The engine never
  reinstalls a hook on its own. Since Step 73 the callback also measures itself and the wait of
  each physical event against the user's `LowLevelHooksTimeout` (capped at 1000 ms, 300 ms when
  absent); one that reaches it turns the engine off (`hook_lost`), releases every key and button,
  strikes the tray icon through and shows a notice; turning the engine on again installs a fresh
  hook ([DDALGAK_ENGINE §16](DDALGAK_ENGINE.md)).
- **Emergency chord** `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Escape` (`DDALGAK-SEC-003`): evaluated first in the
  callback on the *physical* key state (events without `LLKHF_INJECTED`), so no remap, block,
  mode or invalid configuration can hide it. On detection, within the same event: uninstall the
  hook, send key-up for every key and button Ddalgak holds, cancel all runs, set the engine
  `off`, write the emergency marker (§4), and show a non-modal notice. The chord is reserved for
  every Kim tool (HOTKEY_CONTRACT §7.4). Its choice is provisional until it is verified on real
  Windows with physical keys (including keyboards where the chord is awkward and remote-desktop
  sessions); a change goes through an ADR 0017 note and a contract revision. Step 73 tested it in
  the decision core with every key of the chord remapped or blocked, in any order, paused and with
  an empty rule table, documented its interaction with Task Manager's `Ctrl+Shift+Escape` and
  elevated windows ([DDALGAK_ENGINE §16](DDALGAK_ENGINE.md)), and left the physical-keyboard check
  to the maintainer's manual script there; the chord stays provisional until it is run.
- **Other ways out** (`KIM-SEC-023`): the tray menu, the `engine.toggle` shortcut (registered
  with `RegisterHotKey`, independent of the hook), `ddalgak engine off` or `ddalgak disable`,
  `ddalgak-gui.exe --no-hotkeys` or `KIM_NO_HOTKEYS` (starts with every shortcut off and the
  engine off), `Ctrl+Shift+Escape` to end the process; Windows removes the hook when the process
  ends. A stuck key: `ddalgak release` or the tray's *Release stuck keys* (Step 73, §10).
- **Visible hook** (`DDALGAK-SEC-010`): the hook exists only inside the user-started app with
  its tray icon; no CLI command starts the app, creates a tray icon or installs a hook.

## 8. Password fields, secure desktop, privacy

- **Secure desktop** (Ctrl+Alt+Del screen, UAC prompts, sign-in, lock screen) is a separate
  desktop whose input never reaches the user desktop's hooks (*documented*). Ddalgak never tries
  to change that (`DDALGAK-SEC-002`, `KIM-SEC-021`).
- **Password fields.** Before acting, the engine asks whether the focused element is a password
  field (`ES_PASSWORD` edit style, or UI Automation `IsPassword`; best effort, *documented*). If
  it is, every rule is skipped and keys pass unchanged, except the emergency chord. Text is never
  typed into a password field. The recorder (Step 78: only keys typed into the editor's own window, after an explicit start, behind a banner) and hotstrings (Step 69) never record or
  buffer keys there. Detection is best effort: applications that draw their own password fields
  without exposing them may not be recognized, and the documentation says so; rules in such
  applications can be excluded with `except_apps`.
- **No keylogging** (`DDALGAK-SEC-001`): the hook keeps only the state needed for matching (which
  keys are down, a pending sequence step, and since Step 69 the hotstring buffer: at most the
  longest active abbreviation plus one character, only while a hotstring rule exists, cleared on
  every reset — focus change, password field, IME composition, secure desktop, pause, navigation
  and shortcut keys, other programs' input, a match, 10 s idle). Nothing else is retained; the
  buffer is never stored, logged, sent or shown, and a count of key presses (a number) is all a
  typing run learns about what was typed meanwhile.
- **Typing never follows focus** (Step 69): before every `SendInput` call of a run the focused
  window and control are compared with the ones the run started in; a change stops the run
  (`focus_changed`) and nothing is typed into the new window. Disabled and read-only focus
  targets, and a missing or disabled foreground window, are refused (`skipped_disabled_field`).
- **The clipboard is the user's** (Step 69, `paste` only, with `clipboard` consent): Ddalgak copies
  every format first and refuses to paste when one cannot be copied faithfully
  (`clipboard_not_restorable`), keeps the snippet out of clipboard history and the cloud
  clipboard, restores the previous content after 500 ms on every path (a newer clipboard written
  meanwhile by another program wins), and never reads the clipboard otherwise.
- **Activity and logs** contain rule IDs, profile and mode IDs, outcome codes, step indexes and
  durations only; never key names the user typed, text, window titles, paths, arguments, URLs or
  clipboard contents (`DDALGAK-SEC-011`). Persisting them is opt-in. Since Step 69 validation
  messages describe what is wrong with a snippet (its length, the position of a bad character)
  without quoting it, and `ddalgak rule show` replaces snippet text with its counts unless the
  user asks with `--show-text`; a CLI test greps every output for the text.
- **Rule content** is personal data in the user's profile (snippets, paths, URLs). The GUI says
  that `rules.json` is not a password store; an export dialog reminds users that the file
  contains their snippets and targets.

## 9. Linux (X11 and Wayland), milestone D7

Nothing is claimed for Linux before Step 83 (`DDALGAK-NFR-009`). What is already clear:

| Need | X11 | Wayland |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global triggers | `XGrabKey` for chords; full key observation needs extensions (XInput2 raw events) that any X client may use | No global key observation by design; the desktop portal's GlobalShortcuts interface lets an app *request* shortcuts that the compositor and the user bind (the app gets a trigger description, not raw keys) |
| Remapping a key while held | XTest injection plus grabs; fragile but possible | Not available to normal clients; compositor-specific or `uinput` (needs device permissions, usually root or a group) |
| Injecting keys and pointer | XTest | The RemoteDesktop portal (or libei) after the user approves a session in a dialog; reading keys is not part of it |
| Password fields, secure contexts | Toolkit-specific | Compositor-protected |

Ddalgak on Linux will use only supported, user-consented interfaces, never a root daemon or
a world-writable `uinput` setup, and will mark every unavailable trigger or action per desktop
in the matrix and the GUI. The `rules.json` format already stores portable key names, so a
Linux build can read Windows rules and report what it cannot do.

## 10. Input recursion and stuck keys

- **Recursion** is prevented structurally (RULE_MODEL §7.4, `DDALGAK-SEC-004`): Ddalgak's own
  injected events carry its marker and `LLKHF_INJECTED` and are never matched; rules that accept
  other programs' injected input cannot inject; self-triggering outputs are refused; a per-rule
  rate limit stops loops through other automation tools (two remapping programs feeding each
  other) with `rate_limited`.
- **Stuck keys** (`DDALGAK-SEC-005`): the injector keeps a ledger of every key and button it
  pressed. Each entry is released on trigger release, pause, turn-off, emergency, profile or
  mode switch, session lock or secure-desktop switch, a failing run, and in the process exit
  handler. Before typing or sending, held trigger modifiers are logically released and restored
  only if still physically down (`SendInput` does not reset keyboard state, *documented*, M2).
  A consumed key-down always has its key-up consumed. A mode switch (Step 72) is a release path
  like any other: a remap or held button of the old mode never stays down in the new one, and a
  held layer whose key-up may never arrive (another desktop, a lock) ends. Since Step 73 a killed
  app is covered too: the next start releases the keys Ddalgak could have pressed (the eight
  modifiers and every remap or held-button output) that Windows still reports pressed, with a
  masking key before Alt and Win; `ddalgak release` and the tray's *Release stuck keys* do the
  same on request, leave Ddalgak's own ledger to the worker, skip modifiers the hook saw
  physically pressed and make the hook forget its key state. These are single reads of the key
  state at moments a crash or the user defines; nothing polls.
- **Remaps** (Step 68, [ADR 0031](adr/0031-ddalgak-remap-execution-and-mouse-hook.md)): the
  engine core decides every output event and the worker, which owns the ledger, sends it. Shared
  outputs are reference-counted (released when the last remap lets go); a key the user already
  holds is never pressed or released by Ddalgak; a trigger modifier the user lets go of while a
  remap had released it has its up consumed; a reload keeps held outputs until their trigger goes
  up. **An elevated window taking focus** releases every output and forgets the key state,
  because keys typed there never reach the hook (UIPI) and the trigger's up would be lost; the
  release is sent after focus moved and may itself be refused by UIPI (not tested, no elevation
  on this machine). The debug test host never injects.
- **Mouse holds and moves** (Step 71, [ADR 0040](adr/0040-ddalgak-mouse-actions.md)): a held
  button is a remap whose target is the button, so it is on the same reference-counted ledger
  and every release path above (pause, turn-off, emergency, session lock, a desktop switch, an
  elevated window taking focus, the worker's end, the panic hook); a refused down (an elevated
  window or the secure desktop at the point) presses nothing and its release sends no unmatched
  up. A move while held stops on its trigger's release and on every one of those paths, on a
  reload, and after 60 s (`timeout`), so a trigger-up the hook never saw cannot keep the pointer
  moving. Pointer moves and wheel notches are over at once and never enter the ledger. Every
  target is clamped onto the visible desktop (the union of the monitors), so a rule can never
  send the pointer off-screen.
- **Event storms**: auto-repeat fires a rule again only with `repeat: true`, and the rate limit
  applies to it too; the auto-repeat of a held button's or a held move's trigger is consumed and
  fires nothing.

## 11. Risk register and verification plan

Likelihood (L) and impact (I): **H**igh / **M**edium / **L**ow.

| ID | Risk | L | I | Mitigation | Owner step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DR-01 | The hook is slow or blocked and Windows removes it silently, so rules stop without notice | M | M | Short callback, worker threads, hook health check on demand (§7); since Step 73 a callback or physical event that reaches `LowLevelHooksTimeout` turns the engine off with `hook_lost` and a notice | 66, 73, 82 |
| DR-02 | A bug leaves a modifier or mouse button logically pressed | M | H | Injector ledger owned by the worker, reference-counted remap outputs (held mouse buttons included since Step 71), release on every exit path including an elevated window taking focus, tests per path (§10; Step 68 tested the pause and key-reset paths with real input; Step 71 every path for held buttons and moves with a simulated pointer); since Step 73 the start after a crash and `ddalgak release` release stale keys (tested with a killed test host and an injected F20) | 68, 71, 73 |
| DR-03 | The emergency chord does not work on some keyboards, laptops or remote sessions | M | H | Physical-state detection, decided before the rule table (Step 73: tested in the core against remaps of its own keys); laptops, external keyboards, Task Manager and RDP in the maintainer's manual script (DDALGAK_ENGINE §16); an ADR 0017 note if the chord must change | 73 (manual pending) |
| DR-04 | Password-field detection misses custom controls | M | H | Win32 edit styles (Step 66), checked again before every typing call (Step 69); UI Automation and browser fields not yet; `except_apps`; documented as best effort (§8) | 66, 69, 82 |
| DR-05 | Injected 한/영 (`HangulMode`) or Unicode text behaves differently across IME versions | M | M | Real-Windows tests with the Korean IME; `paste` fallback | 68, 69 |
| DR-06 | Users expect AutoHotkey scripts to work | H | M | Matrix with explicit statuses; importer previews only a declarative subset (§5 of the philosophy) | 65, 80 |
| DR-07 | Games or anti-cheat flag Ddalgak | M | M | No concealment or evasion; Gaming profile and pause; honest documentation (§6) | 82 |
| DR-08 | A malicious same-user process edits `rules.json` to add a launch rule with forged consent | L | H | Same-user trust boundary (§1); `.exe`-only launches, no shells; launch consent fingerprints; history shows origin of every change | 67, 82 |
| DR-09 | Two automation tools (Ddalgak and another) feed each other's synthetic input | M | M | `injected: ignore` default, accept-rules cannot inject, rate limit (§10) | 66 |
| DR-10 | Widened remaps capture an OS chord | L | H | Reserved chords and every `Win` chord pass unchanged under widening; an exact chord beats a widened match (§2; core-tested in Step 68) | 68 |
| DR-11 | UIPI failures are silent, so a rule seems to "do nothing" in admin windows | H | L | Integrity check before injecting, `skipped_elevated_target` with an explanation (§3) | 66, 70 |
| DR-12 | Wayland makes key remapping impossible for normal clients | H | M | Linux scope per desktop, no root service, matrix marks gaps (§9) | 83 |

**Manual checks on real Windows** (each owner Step reports evidence or writes **not tested**
with the reason):

| Check | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Hook callback latency and idle cost with 0, 10, 100 and 1000 rules; no timers while idle | 66, 82 |
| Elevated window focus: injecting rules skipped, others run, notice shown | 66, 70 |
| Secure desktop and lock screen: nothing fires; keys released on lock | 73 |
| Password fields in a Win32 edit, a browser and a UWP app: rules skipped, nothing typed | 66, 69 |
| Emergency chord with remaps of Ctrl, Alt, Shift and Escape active, with an invalid file, over RDP | 73 |
| Korean 2-set IME: composition guard, `HangulMode` output, Hangul text typing | 68, 69 |
| US and one AltGr layout: logical versus physical triggers | 68 |
| Stuck keys: kill the app while a remap and a mouse hold are active | 68, 71, 73 |
| Multi-monitor with negative coordinates and mixed DPI for mouse actions (Step 71: synthetic layouts tested, real monitors manual, DDALGAK_ENGINE §14) | 71 |
| A few non-protected games; document behavior honestly | 82 |

**Step 65 ran none of these**: it is a specification. Its machine checks cover the schemas, the
reserved chords, consent, recursion guards, cross-references and the playground's safety
properties (`cargo xtask schema-check`).

**Step 66** (engine, Windows 10 19045; details and evidence in
[DDALGAK_ENGINE §7–§8](DDALGAK_ENGINE.md)): hook latency and idle cost **measured** (decision
0.28 µs per event with 1000 rules in a release build; 60 s idle with 100 rules and the engine
on: 0 ms CPU, no hook or worker wake-ups); hook clean-up on stop, timeout and panic
**tested**; own injected input never matched and other programs' input reaching only
`injected: accept` rules **tested with real `SendInput`** through the running app; DR-09 (two
automation tools feeding each other) is cut by the per-rule rate limit (unit-tested; the
real-input storm and the real held-key release were **not observed**, because the shared
workstation locked during those runs). Password fields: Win32 `ES_PASSWORD` edits are recognized
(tested on a hidden edit); browsers and UWP **not tested** (Step 69). Elevated-window skipping:
implemented, **not tested** (no injecting rule before Step 68; Step 70). The hook health check
of §7 is implemented as `ddalgak health` (passive signals; ADR 0024 §8). The emergency chord with
physical keys and the tray icon are left to the manual check of DDALGAK_ENGINE §8 and Step 73.

**Step 68** (remaps, Windows 10 19045; details in [DDALGAK_ENGINE §11](DDALGAK_ENGINE.md)):
remap press/repeat/release, a block, a dual role (tap and the real timer) and the pause and
key-reset release paths **tested with real `SendInput`** on obscure keys (once, on an unlocked
desktop; later runs reported skipped while the workstation was locked); the on-demand mouse hook
**tested** through the real test host (installed only while a mouse rule is active, every event
passed on); every timing, precedence, reference-count and release rule unit-tested in the core
and the worker. **Not tested** (manual checks in DDALGAK_ENGINE §11): physical typing in
applications and the shell, the Korean IME and `HangulMode` output, a layout switch, Ctrl/Win/Alt
combinations with remaps active, real mouse buttons, an elevated window taking focus or a session
lock while a remap holds its target, and a killed app (Step 73).

**Step 69** (typing, Windows 10 19045; details in [DDALGAK_ENGINE §12](DDALGAK_ENGINE.md)): the exact
event sequences of typed text (multiline, emoji, composed and decomposed Hangul, escapes), chunks,
delays, the insertion point, modifier release and restore, the target checks before every call
(focus change, password field, secure desktop, elevated window, IME composition and native mode,
disabled field), cancellation by pause, the emergency chord and a reload, paste with copy,
private marking and restore of the clipboard, and hotstring matching with every buffer reset are
**tested** with a fake injector, a fake probe, a fake clipboard and synthetic event streams; no
character was injected and the real clipboard was never touched. A CLI test checks that snippet
text appears in no output. Read-only, disabled and password edits are recognized on the test's own
hidden windows. **Not tested** (manual script in DDALGAK_ENGINE §12): real typing into
applications, the Korean IME (DR-05), the real clipboard, browser and UWP password fields (DR-04),
an elevated window and a focus switch during a real run.

**Step 70** (launches, Windows 10 19045; details in [DDALGAK_ENGINE §13](DDALGAK_ENGINE.md),
decision [ADR 0037](adr/0037-ddalgak-program-and-website-launches.md)): programs start with
`CreateProcessW` (the expanded path as application name, nothing searched, a command line quoted
per argument and split back exactly by Windows' own `CommandLineToArgvW` in the tests, no shell,
never elevated: `ERROR_ELEVATION_REQUIRED` becomes `program_requires_elevation`, tested with a
fake because a real elevated target would need UAC); websites and packaged apps go only to the
shell's `open` with a checked `http`/`https` URL or `shell:AppsFolder\<id>`, and every other
scheme (`file:`, `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `data:`, `ms-*:`, `search-ms:`, custom protocols) and
credentials are refused by the schema, the CLI's normalizer, the loader and again by the Windows
layer — **tested** with a fake shell that records the verb and target. Shell hosts are refused by
name and again behind links; a missing or moved program ends with `program_not_found` and is
never searched for; one run per rule at a time and one start per second stop duplicate triggers;
a changed target or environment value makes consent stale; loading, reloading and importing
start nothing; paths, arguments, URL paths and queries and environment values appear in no
output unless `rule show --show-targets`. A **real hidden start** of the test's own program from
a path with spaces and Korean characters, directly and through the real test host on an injected
obscure key, is **tested**. Launches inject nothing, so they still run over an elevated window
(the "others run" half of the elevated-window check above). **Not tested** (manual script in
DDALGAK_ENGINE §13): a real hotkey opening an installed program and a website in the real default
browser, a packaged app, activation of a real window, a real elevated target and whether
Windows' foreground lock lets the new window come to the front.

**Step 71** (mouse actions, Windows 10 19045; details in [DDALGAK_ENGINE §14](DDALGAK_ENGINE.md),
decision [ADR 0040](adr/0040-ddalgak-mouse-actions.md)): moves are absolute moves to a pixel
clamped onto the union of the monitors (relative moves stop where their path leaves the desktop),
in normalized `MOUSEEVENTF_VIRTUALDESK` coordinates computed from positions read in per-monitor
DPI mode; the exact `INPUT` structures of moves, every button's down/up pair, double clicks and
wheel notches are **tested** (built, never sent); logical-to-physical scaling, normalization on
every pixel, multi-monitor layouts with negative coordinates and mixed scales, the grid, speed,
acceleration and its caps are **tested** on synthetic layouts. A held button is on the remap
ledger and a move while held stops on every path; both are **tested** in the core and the real
worker thread with a simulated pointer, and the trigger path is **tested** with the real hook and
real injected obscure keys driving a simulated pointer. The secure desktop and an elevated window
at the point (the capture window during a drag) are refused before every step and every motion
tick; mouse actions need no mouse hook and read positions only when a rule runs. **Not tested**
(manual script in DDALGAK_ENGINE §14; automated tests may not move the pointer of this shared
machine): real pointer movement, scrolling and clicks on real monitors and scales, whether
Windows lands on the exact normalized pixel, an administrator window under the real pointer, a
real drag, games and anti-cheat (no promise is made: programs that read raw relative input may
ignore absolute moves), and a killed app while a button is held (Step 73).

**Step 72** (modes and layers, Windows 10 19045; details in [DDALGAK_ENGINE §15](DDALGAK_ENGINE.md),
decision [ADR 0043](adr/0043-ddalgak-modes-layers-and-runtime-mode-state.md)): mode switches
inject nothing. When the active mode changes, every held remap, held button and motion is
released and pending taps, hold triggers and sequences end, so no key of the old mode stays down
in the new one; held layers end with their key-up, on a key reset, a session lock and a pause;
the active mode is never restored after a restart, a pause or the emergency chord (the default
mode is the one predictable state), and `ddalgak mode reset` and the tray's "Back to …" are the
safe reset. **Tested**: the state machine, precedence along a layer's chain, the releases in the
decision core and the real worker thread, a synthetic typing stream across switches, and mode
rules fired through the real hook by injected obscure keys (F13 held layer, F14 set) in the real
test host. **Not tested** (manual script in DDALGAK_ENGINE §15): switching modes while typing on
the physical keyboard in real applications, the Korean IME during a switch, and the real tray
indicator and its menu.

**Step 73** (enable, disable, pause and recovery, Windows 10 19045; details in
[DDALGAK_ENGINE §16](DDALGAK_ENGINE.md), decision
[ADR 0046](adr/0046-ddalgak-enable-disable-and-recovery.md)): the user's turn-off is remembered
across restarts (never silently re-enabled, also with `engine_on_start: on`); rules, modes and
profiles can be disabled in `rules.json` and only the user turns them on again; the emergency chord
is decided before the rule table and was **tested** in the core with every key of the chord
remapped or blocked, paused, with the stepping-aside flags and an empty table; a hook callback
that reaches `LowLevelHooksTimeout` turns the engine off (`hook_lost`), **tested** with a
debug-lowered threshold and a real injected obscure key; a synthetic session lock (sent only to
the test host's own window) keeps the engine state and makes a real injected key wait, **tested**;
a killed test host comes back off and releases a stale obscure key held by injection, **tested**
with real `SendInput`; a synthetic sign-out stops cleanly and the "reboot" follows the start
policy, **tested**; a shortcut another program owns stays `taken` and is never taken, **tested**;
no engine thread wakes while idle in any state, **tested**. The "secure desktop and lock screen:
nothing fires; keys released on lock" row above is covered by the synthetic lock. **Not tested**
(manual script in DDALGAK_ENGINE §16): the emergency chord on physical keyboards (laptop,
external, with Task Manager and over Remote Desktop), a real lock, sign-out and reboot, a real
stuck modifier after killing the app, a real removal of the hook by Windows (it would freeze the
shared PC's keyboard), and the real tray icon and notices.

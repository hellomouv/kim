# Kim CLI contract

Status: **current** · CLI contract **v1** · Step 07 · Decision: [ADR 0015](adr/0015-cli-contract-and-tool-discovery.md)
· Requirements: `KIM-FR-010`, `KIM-FR-011`, `KIM-FR-012`, `KIM-FR-020`, `KIM-NFR-014`,
`KIM-SEC-013`

Every Kim tool's command line follows this contract: `kim`, `subak` (its whole CLI since
Step 12, [SUBAK_CLI.md](SUBAK_CLI.md)), and every later tool. It is what agents and scripts may
rely on. The `kim` command reference is [KIM_CLI.md](KIM_CLI.md); machine-readable schemas are in
[contracts/schemas/](contracts/schemas/cli-envelope-v1.schema.json).

Words: **MUST**/**MUST NOT** are requirements; **SHOULD** is a strong default that needs a
written reason to break.

## 1. Scope and conformance

- A tool **conforms** to contract v1 when it follows §2–§10. It announces this as
  `"cli_contract": 1` in its capabilities document (§9).
- The rules are enforced by tests: `kim` runs every command against the JSON schemas
  (`crates/kim/tests/cli_contract.rs`), checks streams, exit codes, prompts, permissions,
  partial downloads, offline mode and redaction (`cli_functional.rs`), and proves that headless
  commands start no process (`cli_headless.rs`). Subak is validated against the
  same envelope and capabilities schemas and against its own `subak-cli-v1`, with golden files
  from real runs (`crates/subak/tests/cli.rs`, `crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs`).

## 2. Names and verbs

- The binary is the tool id (`kim`, `subak`). Commands are lowercase words, nouns before verbs
  when grouped: `kim catalog list`, `kim tools describe <tool>`, `kim settings set <k> <v>`.
- Standard verbs: `list` (many), `show`/`describe` (one), `status` (summary), `check` (read-only
  comparison), `install`, `update`, `uninstall`, `set`, `refresh`, `verify`, `version`,
  `capabilities`. A new verb needs a reason that none of these fits.
- Long options are `--kebab-case`; a short alias exists only for very common flags (`-q`, `-v`,
  `-y`). Positional arguments are identifiers (a tool id, a target), never free-form switches.
- Words that are commands are reserved and never valid ids (`check`, `all`, `self`, `list` in
  the catalog).
- The **command name** of an invocation is the dotted path of its words: `catalog.list`,
  `tools.describe`, `settings.set`, `update.check`. It appears in the JSON envelope (§7) and in
  the capabilities document (§9).
- An **alias** (another spelling of the same command, such as `subak list` for `subak ls`, or a
  deprecated spelling such as `subak terminal new`) reports the name of the command it stands
  for, so each data shape has exactly one command name, and only canonical names appear in the
  capabilities document. A deprecated spelling adds a warning (`warnings` in `--json`, one
  stderr line otherwise) and is removed only by a breaking change (§8;
  [ADR 0027](adr/0027-subak-cli-structure-and-headless-control.md)).

## 3. Help, version and discoverability

- `--help` (and `-h`) works on every level, prints to stdout, exits 0, and lists every command
  and flag with a one-line description. Help always says what a command will not do when that
  matters (no background work, no network, nothing installed).
- `--version` (`-V`) prints `<tool> <semver>` and exits 0.
- `--help` and `--version` are human text even when `--json` is also given. The machine-readable
  equivalents are `<tool> version --json` and `<tool> capabilities --json`.
- Running the tool with no command prints help and exits 0; with `--json` it is a `usage` error
  document (exit 2), because a JSON caller always expects JSON.

## 4. Interaction: state changes, `--dry-run`, `--yes`, prompts

Every command has an **effect** (§9): `read`, `write` (the tool's own settings or caches),
`install` (adds, replaces or activates software) or `destructive` (removes software or user
data, ends running work).

1. **Nothing implicit.** A command changes only what its arguments name. Nothing installs,
   updates or starts by itself, nothing runs in the background, and the network is used only by
   commands documented to use it (`KIM-SEC-001`, `KIM-SEC-002`, `KIM-NFR-004`).
2. **`--dry-run`** MUST exist on every command whose effect is not `read`. A dry run performs
   the same validation and planning, prints what would happen (exit 0, or the error the real
   run would hit), downloads no packages and writes nothing. The one documented read it may add
   is fetching the small signed catalog (`catalog refresh --dry-run`,
   `update check --refresh --dry-run`); it is still refused in offline mode.
3. **Confirmation.** `destructive` commands confirm before acting. When the tool cannot ask
   they fail with `confirmation_required` (exit 7) unless `--yes`/`-y` is given. `install`
   commands do not prompt: naming the tool on the command line is the explicit consent.
4. **When a tool may ask.** Only when stdin **and** stderr are terminals, **and** neither
   `--json` nor `--no-input` is given, **and** the environment variable `KIM_NO_INPUT` is not set
   (any value except empty, `0` or `false` counts as set). Otherwise it never prompts and never
   waits for input. Prompts go to stderr.
5. **Headless means headless** (`KIM-FR-012`, NON-NEGOTIABLE). A CLI command never opens a
   window, tray icon, browser or console. Only a command whose capability says
   `"opens_window": true` (e.g. a future `subak gui`) may start a GUI, and only because the user
   ran exactly that command. Child processes are started without a console window.
6. **Cancellation.** Ctrl+C during a long operation cancels it with `cancelled` (exit 8) and
   leaves the previous state intact.

## 5. Exit codes

Exit codes are coarse classes for shell scripts; the error code (§6) is the precise reason.

| Exit | Class | Typical action for a caller |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | success | — |
| 1 | failure: internal error, I/O, permission denied | report; for `permission_denied`, fix folder permissions (Kim never elevates) |
| 2 | usage: invalid arguments or a refused source URL | fix the command line |
| 3 | not found: unknown tool, tool not installed | install explicitly or correct the id |
| 4 | integrity / validation: malformed or untrusted data, failed self-check | do not trust the input; report |
| 5 | incompatible: no fitting release, tool too old, capability missing | update explicitly, or pick another version |
| 6 | unavailable: network down, offline mode, timeout | retry later or with a longer timeout; respect offline mode |
| 7 | conflict / needs confirmation: running tool, busy, dependency missing, stale catalog, already installed | resolve the conflict, or re-run with `--yes` / `--allow-stale` as the user decides |
| 8 | cancelled by the user | nothing changed |

Codes 9–63 are reserved for future classes and are not used. A Rust panic exits 101: it is
always a bug (report it).

## 6. Error-code registry

Error codes are stable `snake_case` strings. They are never renamed or reused; new codes are
additive (§8). Each tool documents its codes here; a tool MUST NOT give a registered code a
different meaning or exit code. `crates/kim/tests/cli_contract.rs` checks that this table, the
`kim-cli-v1` schema and `ErrorCode` in `crates/kim/src/error.rs` agree.

| Code | Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `io` | 1 | A local file-system operation failed. |
| `internal` | 1 | A bug, or the bundled catalog of this build failed verification. |
| `permission_denied` | 1 | The OS refused access (read-only or protected location). Kim never elevates to work around it. |
| `usage` | 2 | Invalid command-line usage: unknown command or flag, missing or bad argument value. |
| `unsupported_source` | 2 | A source URL uses a refused scheme or host (plain `http://` to a non-loopback host, `ftp://`, …). |
| `tool_not_found` | 3 | The named tool is not in the catalog. |
| `not_installed` | 3 | The tool is not installed, or its installed program is missing. |
| `catalog_invalid` | 4 | The catalog document is malformed or violates the format rules. |
| `signature_invalid` | 4 | The catalog signature does not verify, or the signature file is malformed. |
| `untrusted_key` | 4 | The signature was made by a key this build does not trust. |
| `catalog_rollback` | 4 | A fetched catalog is older than, or conflicts with, the trusted one. |
| `integrity_failed` | 4 | A downloaded package does not match the size or SHA-256 in the signed catalog. |
| `package_invalid` | 4 | The package is malformed: bad archive, unsafe paths, missing entrypoint. |
| `self_check_failed` | 4 | The staged program failed its `--version` self-check. |
| `capabilities_invalid` | 4 | A tool's capabilities document is malformed or describes another tool or version. |
| `no_release` | 5 | The tool has no release on the selected channel. |
| `incompatible` | 5 | No release or package fits this machine or this Kim version. |
| `capabilities_unavailable` | 5 | The tool publishes no capabilities (no manifest, or it predates `capabilities --json`). |
| `capability_missing` | 5 | The tool does not offer a command the caller requires. |
| `tool_incompatible` | 5 | The tool's version, CLI contract or capabilities schema does not satisfy the caller. |
| `network_unavailable` | 6 | A source could not be reached or a transfer broke off (offline, DNS, TLS, HTTP error, partial download). |
| `offline_mode` | 6 | Offline mode is on; the command needs the network. |
| `timeout` | 6 | An operation, such as asking another tool, did not finish within its time limit. |
| `tool_running` | 7 | The tool is running; Kim never stops it by itself. |
| `busy` | 7 | Another Kim operation on this tool is in progress. |
| `dependency_missing` | 7 | A dependency must be installed first; Kim never installs it implicitly. |
| `stale_catalog` | 7 | The catalog expired; refresh it or pass `--allow-stale`. |
| `confirmation_required` | 7 | A destructive command needs `--yes` because the tool cannot ask. |
| `already_installed` | 7 | The requested version is already installed; nothing to do (use `--reinstall` to repair). |
| `tool_failed` | 1 | An invoked tool reported an error (its code is in `details` as `tool_code: …`, its message redacted) or did not answer with a JSON envelope (Step 38, §9.8). |
| `cancelled` | 8 | The user cancelled; nothing was changed. |

**Subak codes** (Step 08 `host` prototype, Step 09 Host supervisor and IPC v1, Step 10 Terminal
lifecycle). `subak` also uses `io`, `internal`, `permission_denied`, `usage`, `timeout`,
`confirmation_required` and `cancelled` with the meaning and exit code above, and since Step 38
(`subak interop invoke`, §9.8) `capability_missing` and `tool_incompatible`. For `subak`,
`confirmation_required` also covers a Host refusing to end a busy Terminal without consent (IPC
`busy`). `crates/subak/src/output.rs` tests that this table matches its code.

| Code | Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spawn_failed` | 1 | The Host, its shell or a Terminal's program could not be started (missing program, bad working directory, access denied, a script or file Windows cannot start: `not_executable`); `details` carry the `reason`, and the `hint` says what to run instead. |
| `invalid_name` | 2 | A Terminal name breaks the naming rules ([SESSION_MODEL §3](SESSION_MODEL.md)). |
| `ambiguous_target` | 2 | Several objects match the target (e.g. `host attach` with several running Terminals); `details` list the candidates. Name one exactly. |
| `host_not_running` | 3 | No Subak Host serves the endpoint. |
| `target_not_found` | 3 | The Host has no Terminal, window or pane matching the target (names match exactly, ignoring case). |
| `protocol_error` | 4 | The Host or client sent a malformed or unexpected IPC message. |
| `host_identity_mismatch` | 4 | The endpoint is served by a process that is not a `subak.exe` of this user (a pipe squatter, or a Host that cannot be verified). Nothing was sent to it. |
| `unsupported_platform` | 5 | The command needs an OS feature this platform does not have yet (the Host needs Windows ConPTY until M4). |
| `host_too_old` | 5 | The running Host speaks only older IPC protocol majors than this client. The client never restarts it. |
| `host_too_new` | 5 | The running Host speaks only newer IPC protocol majors than this client. |
| `host_disconnected` | 6 | The Host closed the connection unexpectedly (crashed, killed, or shutting down). |
| `host_unresponsive` | 6 | A verified Host accepted the connection but did not answer the handshake in time. It is neither stopped nor replaced. |
| `host_already_running` | 7 | A Host already serves the endpoint; attach to it or stop it explicitly. |
| `name_conflict` | 7 | Another Terminal already uses the name (names ignore case and Unicode composition). Nothing is renamed or suffixed. |
| `invalid_state` | 7 | The Terminal's state does not allow the operation (`rm` of a running Terminal without `--force`, attaching to a stopped one, acting on one that is still starting). |
| `terminals_running` | 7 | `host stop` would end live Terminals; it does so only with `--kill-terminals` (ADR 0003 §7). |

Since Step 20 the `config` and `profile` groups and `new --profile`
([SUBAK_CLI §3.13](SUBAK_CLI.md), [ADR 0051](adr/0051-subak-settings-profiles-and-appearance.md))
also use `config_invalid` (exit 4; for Subak: `config.toml` is not valid TOML, not a settings
document, or cannot be edited in place without changing other keys; nothing was written) and
`config_from_newer_version` (exit 5; `config_version` above 1, read-only) with Noeul's meaning,
`profile_not_found` (exit 3; no shell profile with this name, names ignore case) with Ddalgak's,
and one code of their own:

| Code | Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `state_corrupt` | 4 | `state.json` is not a valid `subak.state` document (not JSON, a wrong CRC, an invalid structure); `subak state check` reports it, a Host keeps it aside and uses the newest valid backup (Step 29, ADR 0063). |
| `state_from_newer_version` | 5 | `state.json` was written by a newer Subak; it is read-only and never rewritten (Step 29). |
| `secret_in_config` | 4 | The settings to write hold a secret-looking profile value (an environment variable named like a token or password, a value shaped like a token or a URL password, a `--password` argument, or a `***` from an export); Subak never writes secrets into `config.toml`, so nothing was written. |

Since Step 35 the `sftp`, `transfer` and `ssh connect` forwarding options
([SUBAK_CLI §3.23](SUBAK_CLI.md), [ADR 0068](adr/0068-sftp-forwarding-and-jump-hosts.md)) add:

| Code | Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remote_error` | 1 | The SSH server refused an SFTP operation (no such file, permission denied, a failure); `details` carry its status name. |
| `unsafe_path` | 4 | The server listed a file name that is not safe as a local name (`..`, a separator or drive, a Windows device name); nothing was transferred. |
| `ssh_failed` | 6 | ssh could not connect, verify the host key (transfers never trust a new host), or authenticate, or the connection broke off; the message carries ssh's own words. |
| `file_exists` | 7 | The destination of a transfer or `sftp mkdir` already exists; pass `--overwrite` or `--resume`. Nothing was changed. |
| `port_in_use` | 7 | A local port of `--forward` is already taken; nothing was started. |

**Noeul codes** (Step 49 foundation: the resident instance, Noeul IPC v1, region pins requested
from the CLI, `F3` image paste; [ADR 0023](adr/0023-noeul-app-foundation.md). Step 50's
`noeul capture --interactive`/`--cancel` and IPC `capture.region`/`capture.cancel` add no code:
a request while an overlay is open succeeds with `opened: false` ([ADR 0026](adr/0026-noeul-capture-overlay.md));
Step 58's `noeul capture --monitor`/`--window active` add `monitor_not_found` and
`window_not_found` ([ADR 0050](adr/0050-noeul-displays-and-capture-backends.md));
[NOEUL_REQUIREMENTS §7](NOEUL_REQUIREMENTS.md#7-planned-cli-error-codes)). `noeul` also uses
`io`, `internal`, `permission_denied`, `usage`, `protocol_error`, `unsupported_platform`,
`timeout`, `busy`, `confirmation_required`, `cancelled` and the `hotkeys` codes below with the
meaning and exit code above. `crates/noeul/src/error.rs` tests that every code it reports is in
this document with its exit code.

| Code | Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `noeul_start_failed` | 1 | The Noeul instance could not be started, or ended during start-up. |
| `noeul_not_running` | 3 | The command needs the running Noeul (pins, capture, quit), and none runs; start it or pass `--start`. |
| `pin_not_found` | 3 | No open pin with this ID, or no closed pin to reopen. |
| `nothing_to_pin` | 3 | The clipboard or file holds nothing Noeul can pin: it is empty, holds no supported content (or not the kind asked for with `--as`), holds content its program marked private, or the file is missing, a folder or not a picture (Step 55). |
| `history_entry_not_found` | 3 | `noeul history pin|forget <n>` names a capture the history does not hold (or the history is empty); `noeul history list` shows it (Step 60). |
| `monitor_not_found` | 3 | `noeul capture --monitor <n>` names a monitor that is not attached now (`noeul status` lists them, 1 is the leftmost; Step 58). |
| `window_not_found` | 3 | `noeul capture --window active` (or the `capture.window` key) found no window to capture: none has the keyboard focus, the desktop has it, or the window is minimized, hidden by Windows or off every monitor (Step 58). |
| `noeul_identity_mismatch` | 4 | The endpoint is served by a process that is not `noeul.exe` of this user (a pipe squatter, or a process that cannot be verified). Nothing was sent to it. |
| `image_invalid` | 4 | The image is malformed or exceeds the size limits (128 MiB of data, 32767 pixels a side, 40 million pixels; Step 55). |
| `config_invalid` | 4 | `config.toml` is not valid TOML, or `noeul config set` or `reset` cannot edit its layout in place without changing other keys; nothing was written (Step 51). |
| `noeul_incompatible` | 5 | The running Noeul and this CLI share no IPC protocol major. Neither is restarted. |
| `config_from_newer_version` | 5 | `config.toml` was written by a newer Noeul (`schema_version` above 1); it is read-only and never rewritten (Step 51). |
| `desktop_unavailable` | 6 | No unlocked interactive desktop for this user: locked, secure desktop, disconnected remote session, no interactive window station, or no display. Retry after unlocking. |
| `clipboard_unavailable` | 6 | Another program kept the clipboard open for longer than 500 ms. |
| `noeul_unresponsive` | 6 | A verified Noeul accepted the connection but did not answer in time (or closed it). It is not stopped. |

Codes registered for the `hotkeys` command group of every GUI tool
([HOTKEY_CONTRACT §10](HOTKEY_CONTRACT.md)). They are registered so that no tool gives them
another meaning; `kim` implements them since Step 46:

| Code | Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hotkey_invalid` | 2 | The keys do not parse, or use a key, modifier, scope or leader the action does not have. |
| `hotkey_reserved` | 2 | The chord is reserved by the OS, by Kim's GUI rules or by the IME, or the action is not bindable. |
| `action_not_found` | 3 | The tool has no action with this ID. |
| `hotkeys_invalid` | 4 | The stored `hotkeys.json` is malformed or invalid; the tool runs in safe mode. |
| `hotkey_unsupported` | 5 | The binding needs an input capability the tool does not have. |
| `hotkeys_from_newer_version` | 5 | `hotkeys.json` was written by a newer version and is read-only. |
| `hotkey_conflict` | 7 | The change conflicts with another binding; nothing was changed. |

Subak's IPC error codes ([IPC_PROTOCOL](contracts/IPC_PROTOCOL.md)) are a separate namespace;
the CLI maps them onto the codes above (for example IPC `invalid_params` → `usage`).

**Subak's commands** (Step 12, [SUBAK_CLI.md](SUBAK_CLI.md),
[ADR 0027](adr/0027-subak-cli-structure-and-headless-control.md)) are `new`, `ls` (alias `list`),
`info`, `status`, `attach`, `detach`, `rename`, `stop`, `kill`, `rm`, `host start|status|health|
attach|stop|serve` and `capabilities`; `subak terminal new|list|ls|info|rename|attach|stop|kill|rm`
is their deprecated Step 10 spelling (an alias, §2). The `data` of every command is published as
[subak-cli-v1](contracts/schemas/subak-cli-v1.schema.json), with golden files from real runs in
`contracts/examples/subak-cli-v1/`; its Terminal, Window and Pane definitions are those of
`ipc-v1`, copied verbatim. `new`, `ls`, `info`, `rename`, `stop`, `kill`, `rm` and `detach` answer
the result of the IPC method they call (`terminal.create`, `.list`, `.info`, `.rename`, `.stop`,
`.kill`, `.remove`, `client.detach`) plus `host` where useful (`{pid, started}` for `new`, `{pid}`
for `ls` and `detach`, `null` when no Host runs); `status` combines `host.status` and
`terminal.list` and reports `running: false` (exit 0) without a Host; the `host` commands answer
the shapes of [IPC_PROTOCOL §4.1](contracts/IPC_PROTOCOL.md) and [CONPTY_PROOF.md](CONPTY_PROOF.md).
Since Step 21 ([ADR 0054](adr/0054-subak-internal-windows-and-panes.md)) the internal windows and
panes add the command groups `subak window new|ls|select|rename|kill` and `subak pane
new|ls|select|kill` (command names `window.new` … `pane.kill`; tmux's long names such as
`new-window` and `kill-pane` are aliases, §2). Each answers the result of its IPC method
(`window.create`, `window.list`, `window.select`, `window.rename`, `window.kill`, `pane.create`,
`pane.list`, `pane.select`, `pane.kill`), typed in `subak-cli-v1`; `select`, `rename` and `new`
take `--dry-run`, and `kill` is destructive (asks, or needs `--yes`). They add no error code: a
target of the wrong level is `usage` (exit 2), another Terminal's window or pane under a Terminal
is `target_not_found` (exit 3), the last running window or pane of a Terminal is `invalid_state`
(exit 7, `details.reason` `last_window` or `last_pane`; `subak kill` ends a Terminal), and a
busy pane without consent is `confirmation_required` (exit 7).
Step 22 ([ADR 0056](adr/0056-subak-pane-splits-and-layout.md)) adds `subak pane
split|resize|swap|zoom` and `subak window rotate|layout` (tmux aliases `split-window`,
`resize-pane`, `swap-pane`, `rotate-window`, `select-layout`), answering `pane.split` (as
`pane.new`) and `result_layout` of `pane.adjust`, `pane.swap`, `pane.zoom`, `window.rotate` and
`window.select_layout`; all take `--dry-run` and add no error code (a pane too small to split is
`invalid_state`, exit 7).
Step 24 ([ADR 0058](adr/0058-subak-tmux-commands-copy-mode-and-buffers.md)) adds `subak command`
(alias `subak tmux`; data `{results: [{command, method, result}]}` or a dry-run plan) and `subak
buffer ls|show|set|delete|paste` (`buffer.*` results). Parse errors are `usage` with a stable
`details` `kind`; kills need `--yes` (`confirmation_required`); no error code is added.
Step 27 ([ADR 0061](adr/0061-claude-code-hooks-and-session-events.md)) adds `subak claude hooks
status|install|uninstall [--settings <file>]` (no Host; an invalid settings file is
`config_invalid`), `subak claude status [target]` (`result_claude_status`) and `subak claude
report`, which a Claude Code hook runs: it is the one command that **always exits 0** and prints
nothing without `--json` (a hook must never disturb Claude); its data says whether the event was
delivered. No error code is added.
Step 29 ([ADR 0063](adr/0063-durable-terminal-state.md)) adds `subak state
show|check|backups|forget|policy|rollback` (errors `state_corrupt`, `state_from_newer_version`);
Step 30 ([ADR 0064](adr/0064-cold-recovery-and-claude-resume.md)) adds `subak recover list` and
`subak recover <terminal>`, which is not destructive but starts processes, so it needs `--yes`
(`confirmation_required` without it) like the destructive commands.
`capture`, `history` and `clear-history` (Step 13, [SCROLLBACK.md](SCROLLBACK.md)) answer
`pane.capture` (all pages joined, plus `name` and `requests`), its counters with the Terminal's
`name` and `state`, and `pane.clear_history` plus `name`; `capture` redacts secret-looking
values unless `--no-redact` (§10), and `clear-history` is `destructive` (asks, or needs `--yes`).
`attach` and `host attach` (and `new --attach`) stream the terminal, so `--json` is accepted only
with `--dry-run`. Meanings and consent are in [SESSION_MODEL §4](SESSION_MODEL.md): `stop`,
`kill` and `rm` are `destructive` and ask, or need `--yes`; `host stop` with live Terminals also
needs `--kill-terminals`; `detach` (effect `write`) never stops anything and never asks. `new`,
`ls`, `info`, `rm`, `attach` and `detach` are tmux words outside §2's standard verbs, chosen for
familiarity and to match the IPC methods (ADR 0020, ADR 0027). `new` runs `-- <program>
[args…]` as separate words, never through a shell, with the program resolved on the pane's
`PATH`, or one verbatim `--command-line` (only its first word resolved); `--env NAME=VALUE`,
`--env NAME` and `--unset-env NAME` adjust the pane's environment; `--dry-run` reports the
resolved `executable` also without a Host ([PTY_PROCESSES](PTY_PROCESSES.md)); only `new` starts
a Host on demand, and `--no-start` forbids even that. Since Step 20 `config show|check|set|reset|
export|import` and `profile list|show` ([SUBAK_CLI §3.13](SUBAK_CLI.md)) read and edit
`config.toml` without contacting a Host (`config reset --all` is `destructive`; `set`, `reset`
and `import` take `--dry-run`), and `new --profile <name>` (or the default profile) adds
`profile` to `new`'s data.

**Ddalgak codes** (Step 66 engine commands, [DDALGAK_ENGINE §6](DDALGAK_ENGINE.md); Step 67 rule
commands, [DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL §13](DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL.md)). `ddalgak` also uses `io`,
`internal`, `permission_denied` (a read-only `rules.json` or folder), `usage`, `not_installed`
(`ddalgak-gui.exe` is missing next to `ddalgak.exe`), `protocol_error`, `unsupported_platform`,
`busy` (another writer holds the rules lock), `confirmation_required` (`rule delete`,
`rules restore`, `rules draft discard` without `--yes` when it cannot ask), `cancelled` and the
`hotkeys` codes `hotkey_invalid` and `hotkey_reserved` (a rule trigger that does not parse or is
reserved) with the meaning and exit code above. `crates/ddalgak/src/output.rs` tests that this
table matches its code; the `data` of every command is published as
[ddalgak-cli-v1](contracts/schemas/ddalgak-cli-v1.schema.json), with examples generated from
real runs. The mode commands (Step 72) and the profile commands (Steps 75, 81) use the codes below.

| Code | Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hook_failed` | 1 | Windows refused the low-level keyboard hook; the engine stays off. |
| `rule_invalid` | 2 | The requested rule breaks the schema or a semantic rule (DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL §8); nothing was written. |
| `mode_invalid` | 2 | Step 72: the requested mode breaks the schema or a semantic rule (a parent cycle, an unknown parent, a default mode with a parent, `one_shot` or `timeout_ms`; DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL §7.3); nothing was written. |
| `engine_not_running` | 3 | The command needs the running tray app (`ddalgak-gui.exe`); the CLI never starts it. |
| `rule_not_found` | 3 | No rule with this ID. |
| `profile_not_found` | 3 | No profile with this ID. |
| `mode_not_found` | 3 | No mode with this ID in the rule's profile. |
| `snapshot_not_found` | 3 | The backup, history snapshot or draft to restore or apply does not exist. |
| `app_identity_mismatch` | 4 | The endpoint is served by a process that is not `ddalgak-gui.exe` of this user. Nothing was sent to it. |
| `rules_invalid` | 4 | `rules.json` is malformed or not a usable `ddalgak.rules` document; the engine cannot be turned on with it, a running engine keeps its previous rules, and it is never rewritten automatically. |
| `import_invalid` | 4 | Step 75: the file given to `ddalgak profile import` is not JSON, not a `ddalgak.rules` document, or fails the schema outside its rules (a corrupt or truncated export); nothing was imported. A newer file is `rules_from_newer_version`. |
| `rules_from_newer_version` | 5 | `rules.json` was written by a newer Ddalgak; it is not run and never rewritten. Since Step 75 also a file to import that a newer Ddalgak wrote; nothing was imported. |
| `engine_elevated` | 5 | The app runs as administrator; it refuses to turn its engine on elevated (DDALGAK_SAFETY §3). |
| `app_unresponsive` | 6 | The verified app accepted the connection but did not answer in time. It is neither stopped nor restarted. |
| `engine_off` | 7 | Pause or resume needs the engine on; resume never turns it on. Since Step 72 also `mode set`, `toggle` and `reset`: an engine that is off has no active mode. |
| `app_already_running` | 7 | `ddalgak-gui.exe`: another instance already owns this user session; the new one exits without touching it. |
| `rule_conflict` | 7 | The change would give a rule a trigger another enabled rule (or Ddalgak's own shortcut) already has, an ID is taken, or the rules changed since the revision the caller read; nothing was written. `details` list the problems with their offers. |
| `consent_required` | 7 | The change needs `--allow <permission>`; a new rule was saved disabled, anything else was not written. |
| `mode_in_use` | 7 | Step 72: `mode delete` of the default mode, of a mode other modes are layers over, of a mode a rule switches to, or of a mode rules are limited to without `--delete-rules`; nothing was written. `details` name the rules and modes that use it. |
| `mode_disabled` | 7 | Step 73: `mode set` or `mode toggle` (or the tray's mode menu) to a mode the user disabled; nothing changed. `ddalgak enable --mode <id>` turns it on again. |
| `profile_in_use` | 7 | Step 75: `profile delete` of the active profile (switch first with `ddalgak profile apply <other>`) or of the only profile; nothing was written. |

## 7. Output streams and the `--json` envelope

**Streams.** Results go to **stdout**. Warnings, progress, prompts, diagnostics and human error
messages go to **stderr**. A failing command writes nothing to stdout in human mode. Output is
UTF-8 (`KIM-NFR-013`). Kim prints no color; a tool that adds color MUST honor `NO_COLOR` and
never color non-terminal output.

**Human errors** look like this, on stderr:

```text
kim: error: no tool `nope` in the catalog
  - <one line per detail, if any>
hint: known tools: kim, subak
```

**`--quiet` / `-q`** suppresses warnings and progress on stderr; results and errors still
appear. **`--verbose` / `-v`** adds diagnostic lines (`<tool>: …`) on stderr: which catalog
was used, what is fetched, timing, the error code and exit code. Neither flag ever changes
stdout. They conflict with each other (`usage`).

**`--json`** prints exactly **one** JSON document on stdout — also for failures, including
argument errors — and nothing else on stdout. Human progress is suppressed; stderr stays empty
unless `--verbose` is given. The document is
[cli-envelope-v1](contracts/schemas/cli-envelope-v1.schema.json):

```json
{ "ok": true, "command": "catalog.list", "schema_version": 1, "data": { }, "warnings": [] }
```

```json
{ "ok": false, "command": "tools.describe", "schema_version": 1,
  "error": { "code": "not_installed", "exit_code": 3, "message": "subak is not installed",
             "hint": "install it explicitly with `kim install subak`", "details": [] } }
```

- `command` is the command name (§2); when the arguments cannot be parsed it is the longest
  recognized command path, or the tool name alone (`"kim"`).
- `data` is always an object, so it can grow. `warnings` are human sentences; `details` lists
  individual findings (e.g. every validation problem).
- `error.exit_code` always equals the process exit code.
- Formatting (indentation, key order) is not part of the contract.
- Each tool publishes the `data` of its commands as a schema: `kim` in
  [kim-cli-v1](contracts/schemas/kim-cli-v1.schema.json), with examples generated from real
  runs in `contracts/examples/kim-cli-v1/`.

## 8. Versioning and compatibility

Three version numbers are independent (`KIM-NFR-014`):

| Version | Where | Changes when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tool version (SemVer) | `--version`, `capabilities.version` | every release of the tool |
| CLI contract major | `capabilities.cli_contract` | this document changes incompatibly |
| JSON schema version | envelope `schema_version`, `capabilities.json_schema_version` | a tool's `--json` output changes incompatibly |

**Additive changes keep the version:** a new command, a new optional flag, a new field in
`data`, a new error code, a new enum value (e.g. a new tool status), a new warning. Consumers
MUST ignore unknown fields and MUST handle unknown enum values and error codes by their exit
class (§5) — an unknown capability `effect` is treated as `destructive`.

**Breaking changes bump `schema_version`** (or the contract major): removing or renaming a
field, changing a type or meaning, changing an exit code, removing a command. A breaking change
ships with migration notes, and the previous major stays selectable for at least one minor
release (the selection mechanism is specified together with the first v2; none exists yet).

The published schemas are deliberately **closed** (no unknown fields) so regression tests
notice every change; updating a schema for an additive change is part of that change.

## 9. Capabilities, discovery and tool-to-tool invocation

Tools find and use each other without a resident orchestrator (`KIM-FR-020`): there is no
registry service and no daemon. Discovery reads files; invocation starts the other tool as a
short-lived process with a time limit. MCP may be added per tool later as an optional,
additional interface (`KIM-FR-021`).

### 9.1 `<tool> capabilities --json`

Every tool MUST implement `capabilities`. Its `data` is a
[tool-capabilities-v1](contracts/schemas/tool-capabilities-v1.schema.json) document:

```json
{ "schema": "kim.capabilities", "schema_version": 1, "tool": "subak", "version": "0.0.1",
  "cli_contract": 1, "json_schema_version": 1, "implementation": "implemented",
  "summary": "…",
  "commands": [ { "name": "capabilities", "usage": "subak capabilities [--json]",
                  "summary": "…", "effect": "read", "network": false, "dry_run": false,
                  "requires_yes": false, "opens_window": false } ] }
```

- It lists every command the tool really has, nothing planned. A placeholder says
  `"implementation": "placeholder"`; a tool whose listed commands all work says `implemented`
  even while it is pre-alpha (Subak since Step 11; its `summary` says what is missing).
- `effect` is the strongest effect the command can have with any flag; `network` says it may use
  the network; `dry_run` and `requires_yes` describe §4; `opens_window` is true only for GUI
  launchers.
- The command MUST be cheap and side-effect free: no network, no writes, no Host or GUI start,
  no prompt, answer within one second.

### 9.2 Static manifest

A package SHOULD ship the same document as `capabilities.json` at its root. Kim's installer
keeps it at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\mouv\<tool>\versions\<version>\capabilities.json`, so
`kim tools list|describe` show capabilities **without starting the tool**. A manifest must name
the installed tool and version exactly; otherwise it is `capabilities_invalid` and never
trusted. Release packaging (Step 40) generates it from `<tool> capabilities --json`.

### 9.3 Discovery with Kim

- `kim tools list --json`: every installed tool (and Kim itself) with version, absolute
  executable path, status and a capabilities summary. Reads install records and manifests only.
- `kim tools describe <tool> --json`: one tool with its full capabilities document (manifest,
  or Kim's built-in one). `--probe` asks the tool itself instead (§9.5).
- Callers that already know a tool's path may run `<path> capabilities --json` directly.

### 9.4 Version negotiation

A caller states what it needs; the answer is success or one structured error:

| Situation | Error | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The tool is not installed (or its program is missing) | `not_installed` | 3 |
| Installed version does not satisfy a SemVer requirement | `tool_incompatible` | 5 |
| Different `cli_contract` major, or a capabilities `schema_version` the caller cannot read | `tool_incompatible` | 5 |
| No capabilities available (no manifest, or an old tool without `capabilities`) | `capabilities_unavailable` | 5 |
| A required command is not listed | `capability_missing` | 5 |
| The document is malformed or names another tool/version | `capabilities_invalid` | 4 |
| The tool did not answer in time | `timeout` | 6 |

Kim implements this as
`kim tools describe <tool> [--require-version <req>] [--require-command <name>]… [--probe]`,
so a script or agent can check requirements in one call. The envelope's `schema_version` is
checked the same way: a caller that knows v1 refuses a v2 document with `tool_incompatible`.

### 9.5 Invoking another tool

A tool (or agent) that calls another Kim tool MUST:

1. Resolve the executable from `kim tools list --json` (or an explicit path); never through a
   shell.
2. Pass `--json` and `--no-input`, close stdin, and start the process without a console window
   (`CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on Windows). Never pass `--yes` on the user's behalf (§9.6).
3. Bound the call with a timeout (default 5 s for `capabilities`, 30 s for other read commands;
   long operations report progress instead of blocking), kill the child on expiry and report
   `timeout`.
4. Parse the envelope, check `schema_version`, and map failures to the codes of §9.4; a
   non-JSON answer is `capabilities_unavailable` for `capabilities`, otherwise the callee's own
   error code is passed through in `details`.
5. Cap captured output (Kim: 1 MiB) and redact it (§10) before showing or logging it.

`kim tools describe --probe` is the reference implementation (`kim::capabilities::probe`).

### 9.6 Consent and permissions per effect

| Effect of the called command | A tool may invoke it… |
| --- | --- |
| `read` | at any time, e.g. to show status; still bounded by §9.5 |
| `write` | only as the direct result of an explicit user action in the calling tool that names the change |
| `install` | only when the user explicitly asked for that install or update; suggest `--dry-run` first |
| `destructive` | as `install`, and only after the user confirmed in the caller's own UI; only then may the caller pass `--yes` |
| `opens_window: true` | never from a headless path |

Calls are local and run as the same user. No tool accepts remote invocation unless the user
explicitly enabled it (`SUBAK-SEC-012`).

### 9.8 Capabilities across tools (Step 38)

A tool lists what other tools may call under `provides` in its capabilities document (a dotted
id, its own interface SemVer, the effect, network and window facts) and serves it as
`<tool> interop invoke --json --no-input` with a `kim.interop.request` v1 document on stdin.
`kim tools find <capability>` lists providers from manifests; `kim tools invoke <capability>`
calls one under §9.5 and §9.6 (write needs `--allow-write`, destructive also `--yes`, install
never, windows only with `--allow-window`; a dry run needs no consent) and maps failures to
`capability_missing`, `not_installed`, `tool_incompatible`, `confirmation_required`, `timeout`
and `tool_failed`. The interfaces, workflows and the compatibility policy are in
[INTEROP.md](INTEROP.md) ([ADR 0071](adr/0071-capability-interop.md)).

### 9.7 No orchestrator

There is no Kim daemon, registry service or background discovery. Each call is a short-lived
process, idle cost is zero (`KIM-NFR-001`), and a missing or broken tool affects only the calls
that need it. Step 38 may extend interoperability (e.g. richer per-command schemas or MCP), but
within these rules.

## 10. Secrets and redaction

Secrets never appear in JSON output, human output, diagnostics or stored state (`KIM-SEC-013`).

- Every string a tool prints passes through redaction at the output boundary, and every URL a
  tool stores in its own state is redacted first (Kim: the `source_url` of install records and
  refresh results).
- **User-info** in a URL (`https://user:password@host/…`, `https://token@host/…`) becomes
  `https://***@host/…`.
- **Secret-looking parameters** in a query or fragment (names containing `token`, `secret`,
  `pass`, `pwd`, `key`, `sig`, `auth`, `credential`, `session`, `code`, `cookie`) keep their name
  and lose their value: `?token=***&v=2`.
- Redaction is deliberately over-eager; hiding a harmless value is acceptable. The real value is
  still used internally (e.g. to download), it is only never shown or stored.
- Subak has **one** secret detector (`crates/subak/src/redact.rs`) for captured output and for
  every command it shows (a pane's `program`, `args` and verbatim `command_line` in `new`,
  `info`, `ls`, `status`, `host status`, dry runs, events and error details): secret-looking
  `name=value` pairs and options, `Bearer` credentials, token shapes (`ghp_…`, `github_pat_…`,
  `sk-…`, `xoxb-…`, `AKIA…`, JSON Web Tokens and the others of
  [SCROLLBACK §6](SCROLLBACK.md)) and URL passwords become `***`. Until Step 16 commands used a
  weaker rule set that missed token shapes (found by e2e run 2).
- Tools MUST NOT print environment variable values, request headers or file contents that may
  hold secrets; proxy URLs from `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` are redacted like any other URL.
- Subak's environment overrides (`subak new --env NAME=VALUE`, `--env NAME`, IPC
  `terminal.create` `env`) are used once to start the pane and never stored, logged or shown:
  every output names the variables only (`env: {set, unset}`), and errors never echo a value.
  `--env NAME` copies the caller's own value, so a token need not appear on a command line
  ([PTY_PROCESSES §3](PTY_PROCESSES.md); proven by
  `crates/subak/tests/pty_shells.rs::the_pane_environment_keeps_the_users_locations_and_secrets_never_leak`).
- Kim's implementation is `kim::redact`; `cli_functional.rs` proves that credentials in a source
  URL, a proxy URL and a signed download URL never reach stdout, stderr (also with `--verbose`)
  or `current.json`.

## 11. What this contract does not cover

- Subak's IPC protocol and state files ([IPC_PROTOCOL](contracts/IPC_PROTOCOL.md),
  [STATE_SCHEMA](contracts/STATE_SCHEMA.md)).
- GUI behavior ([DESIGN_SYSTEM](DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)); GUIs reach the same operations through the
  library or the CLI (`KIM-FR-013`).
- Shell completion scripts and localized messages (not provided yet).

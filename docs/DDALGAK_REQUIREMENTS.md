# Ddalgak Requirements

Status: **current** (Step 65, specification; the engine rows of D2 are implemented since Step 66
and the rule-store rows `DDALGAK-FR-005…007`, `DDALGAK-FR-009` since Step 67; remap and block
(`DDALGAK-FR-010`) and mouse-button triggers (`DDALGAK-FR-071`, middle and X buttons) since Step
68, whose real-keyboard and mouse checks are still manual; send keys, type text and hotstrings
(`DDALGAK-FR-011`, `DDALGAK-FR-012`, `DDALGAK-FR-070`) since Step 69, whose real-application,
IME and clipboard checks are manual; program and website launches (`DDALGAK-FR-013`,

`DDALGAK-SEC-003`, `DDALGAK-SEC-005`, with per-mode and per-profile `enabled`) since Step 73, whose
physical emergency-chord, real lock, sign-out, reboot and stuck-key checks are manual; see
[DDALGAK_ENGINE](DDALGAK_ENGINE.md) §8, §10, §11, §12, §13, §14, §15 and §16 for what was
verified; the rule editor (`DDALGAK-FR-050…053`, the GUI half of `DDALGAK-FR-007` with undo,
the export and import hooks of `DDALGAK-FR-032`, `DDALGAK-NFR-007`) since Step 74, whose visible
window, screen-reader and real-IME checks are manual and whose `DDALGAK-NFR-003` editor budget is
met only without rules so far, see [DDALGAK_GUI_JOURNEYS §7](DDALGAK_GUI_JOURNEYS.md); profiles
with switch, versions, rollback, export and import (`DDALGAK-FR-030…032`, `DDALGAK-SEC-013`) since

## 0. How to read this document

- **IDs** are unique and permanent: `DDALGAK-FR-ddd` (functional), `DDALGAK-NFR-ddd`
  (non-functional), `DDALGAK-SEC-ddd` (security, privacy and safety). IDs are never renumbered
  or reused; a dropped requirement is marked *withdrawn*. `cargo xtask docs-check` validates the
  rows and every reference.
- **Platform requirements still apply.** Every `KIM-*` requirement in
  [PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS](PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md) binds Ddalgak too: no automatic installs or
  updates (`KIM-SEC-001`), headless means headless (`KIM-FR-012`), no account or telemetry
  (`KIM-SEC-010…012`), secrets never in logs (`KIM-SEC-013`), the hotkey contract
  (`KIM-FR-040…046`, `KIM-SEC-020…023`). This document adds what is specific to Ddalgak.
- **Priority:** `P0` must ship in its milestone · `P1` should ship · `P2` tracked, not promised.
- **Verify:** `T` automated test · `M` manual check on real Windows · `I` inspection · `D`
  documentation exists and is accurate.
- **NON-NEGOTIABLE** requirements may not be relaxed by any ADR, setting, default, flag or test
  shortcut.

## 1. Milestones

| Milestone | Goal | Steps | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **D1 – Specification** | Philosophy, requirements, rule model and schemas, GUI journeys, safety scope, AutoHotkey matrix | 65 | Docs current; `schema-check` proves the fixtures |
| **D2 – Engine core** | Hook engine, rule store and CRUD with validation, enable/pause/disable and emergency recovery | 66, 67, 73 | All `P0` D2 rows pass, including manual Windows checks |
| **D3 – Core actions** | Remap and block, send keys, Unicode text, programs and websites, mouse, modes | 68–72 | Each action passes its tests and a real-Windows check |
| **D4 – Visual editor** | Rule editor, profiles with history and export, test playground | 74–76 | A first-time user completes the journeys of [GUI_JOURNEYS](DDALGAK_GUI_JOURNEYS.md) |
| **D5 – Context and advanced automation** | App conditions and precedence, macros and recorder, window/clipboard/scheduled actions, AutoHotkey import | 77–80 | Per row |
| **D6 – Integration and first release** | Complete headless CLI, opt-in MCP, Kim integration, hardening, first Windows release through Kim | 81, 82 | Release checklist of [RELEASE_POLICY](RELEASE_POLICY.md) and all `P0` rows of D2–D6 |
| **D7 – Linux** | Linux backends where the desktop allows them | 83 | Linux rows pass on real Linux desktops |

Until D6 ships, the Kim catalog lists Ddalgak as *planned* (`KIM-FR-051`).

## 2. Functional requirements

### 2.1 Product, process and engine

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DDALGAK-FR-001 | Ddalgak is one independently installable package with two binaries: `ddalgak.exe` (headless CLI, links no GUI toolkit) and `ddalgak-gui.exe` (tray app that owns the engine, the editor and the playground). It needs no AutoHotkey runtime, Electron, resident Kim process, account or cloud service, and no other Kim tool. | P0 | D2 | I, T |
| DDALGAK-FR-002 | The engine has three states, `off`, `running` and `paused`, shown in the tray icon (shape and text, not color alone), the GUI header and `ddalgak status --json`. The keyboard hook exists only in `running` and `paused`. | P0 | D2 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-003 | The app starts with the engine `off` unless the user chose "start with the engine on" (`engine_on_start: on`). After an unclean exit or an emergency off it always starts `off` and says why. | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-004 | The engine is turned on from the tray, the GUI, the `engine.toggle` shortcut (registered with `RegisterHotKey`, so it works while the hook is off) or `ddalgak engine on` against the running app. A rule can pause, resume or turn the engine off, never on. | P0 | D2 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-005 | Rules are stored in `%APPDATA%\mouv\ddalgak\rules.json` as a `ddalgak.rules` v1 document ([ddalgak-rules-v1](contracts/schemas/ddalgak-rules-v1.schema.json)), written atomically with a backup, with a `revision` that makes concurrent GUI and CLI edits fail instead of overwriting each other. | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-006 | Validation applies the schema and the semantic rules of [RULE_MODEL §8](DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL.md) with stable codes. A rule with an error is inactive and the others keep working; a file that fails the schema is never loaded, and a running engine keeps its previous rules. | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-007 | Rule CRUD: create, show, edit, delete, duplicate, enable, disable and reorder, in the GUI and the CLI, with `--json` and `--dry-run`; delete asks for confirmation (`--yes` headless) and can be undone in the GUI. | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-008 | Triggers use the hotkey contract's key syntax with Ddalgak's extensions (bare side-specific modifiers, lock keys), up to four-chord sequences, `press`, `release` and `hold`, auto-repeat, pass-through and an injected-input policy ([RULE_MODEL §3](DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL.md)). | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-009 | A running app picks up a valid change to `rules.json` (from the GUI or the CLI) within one file-change notification, without restarting, without stuck keys and without dropping unrelated rules. | P0 | D2 | T |

### 2.2 Core action types

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DDALGAK-FR-010 | **Remap**: a key acts as another key or chord for exactly as long as it is held, with modifiers handled as in [RULE_MODEL §5.1](DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL.md), an optional tap alternative (dual role), and **block** to disable a key or chord. | P0 | D3 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-011 | **Send keys**: a trigger taps a chord or a sequence of up to eight chords. | P0 | D3 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-012 | **Type text**: Unicode text up to 4096 characters (Hangul, emoji, newlines, tabs) is typed independent of keyboard layout and IME, or pasted through the clipboard, which is restored afterwards. | P0 | D3 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-013 | **Open a program** by absolute path or packaged-app ID, with an argument list, working folder, window state and "bring to front if running". | P0 | D3 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-014 | **Open a website**: an `http` or `https` URL opens in the user's default browser. | P0 | D3 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-015 | **Mouse**: move relative, absolute or continuously while held (speed, acceleration), scroll by notches in four directions, click, double-click or hold any of five buttons, across monitors with negative coordinates, clamped to the visible desktop. Step 71: implemented with per-monitor DPI scaling, normalized absolute moves, grid units and stepped holds (ADR 0040); real-pointer checks manual. | P0 | D3 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-016 | **Modes**: users create, rename, duplicate and delete modes per profile; rules can be limited to modes; actions set, toggle, cycle, hold (while the trigger is held), return to the previous and to the default mode. The active mode is shown (optional compact indicator) and readable headlessly. Step 72: implemented with layers over a parent, one-shot and timed exits, `ddalgak mode …` and the tray indicator; the active mode is never restored (ADR 0043); real-typing and tray checks manual. | P0 | D3 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-017 | **Engine control** actions pause, resume, toggle pause and turn the engine off. Rules made only of engine-control steps keep working while paused. | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-018 | **Ordered steps**: a rule runs up to 32 steps in order with delays (total at most 60 s) and a stop-or-continue error policy. One run per rule at a time; a trigger during a run is reported as `busy`. Step 78: implemented as macros with a bounded `times` (ADR 0079; one typing run or macro at a time). | P1 | D3 | T |

### 2.3 Selection, modes and conditions

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DDALGAK-FR-020 | Exactly one rule wins per trigger event, chosen by the deterministic precedence of [RULE_MODEL §7](DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL.md) (mode-scoped, then condition specificity, then priority, then order). Unmatched keys reach the application unchanged. | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-021 | A rule with conditions (`when`) or a step type this version cannot evaluate is inactive with a stated reason; it is never treated as unconditional. | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-022 | App conditions: focused program by file name or path, exclusions, and window title (contains or equals); evaluated only at trigger time. Step 77: implemented (ADR 0078; unknown windows never match; titles never kept); real per-app firing checked manually. | P1 | D5 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-023 | `ddalgak explain <keys> --mode <m> --app <exe> --json` and the playground show every candidate with why it won or lost, without running anything. Step 77: implemented as `ddalgak explain <keys> --context <json>` (and `ddalgak test --mode --app --title`). | P1 | D5 | T |

### 2.4 Profiles, history, import and export

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DDALGAK-FR-030 | Profiles: create, rename, duplicate, delete and switch; a switch is atomic (all rules of the old profile stop, held keys are released, then the new profile applies). Step 75: implemented (`ddalgak profile …`, the editor's Profiles page; the switch ends every pending and held action of the old profile between two hook callbacks and starts the new one in its default mode; ADR 0052). | P0 | D4 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-031 | History: every applied change keeps a snapshot; the user can compare and restore an earlier state, which is itself a new, undoable change. Step 75: per-profile versions from the history and labelled save points, a side-by-side comparison, restore and rollback to the newest working version. | P1 | D4 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-032 | Export writes a portable `ddalgak.rules` document without consent or settings. Import validates, shows a diff and adds profiles with every rule disabled until reviewed; it never activates a profile or grants consent. Step 75: whole profiles, with known-folder paths and environment values withheld on export; corrupt and newer files refused; a validation preview. | P0 | D4 | T |

### 2.5 Test playground

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DDALGAK-FR-040 | Simulation (the default): for an event and a context (profile, mode, app, focus kind, engine state) Ddalgak reports a `ddalgak-simulation-v1` trace: decision, candidates and the effect of every step. Nothing is injected, opened or changed. Available in the GUI and as `ddalgak test --dry-run --json`. Step 76: implemented (`ddalgak::simulate`, `ddalgak test`, the editor's Playground page; ADR 0077). | P0 | D4 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-041 | Live test: input goes only into the playground's own test field; a program or website opens only after a confirmation for that launch; reset restores the playground and never touches active rules. Step 76: implemented (typing and shortcuts written into the field, never sent; pointer, mode and engine stay simulated; *Confirm and open* per step); visible checks manual. | P1 | D4 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-042 | Unsaved drafts can be simulated and live-tested before they are saved or activated. Step 76: implemented (`ddalgak test --draft`; the playground's *Include the unsaved rule being edited*). | P1 | D4 | T |

### 2.6 GUI

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DDALGAK-FR-050 | A rule can be created in four steps: capture the trigger, pick one of the effect tiles, fill one form, save; with keyboard-only capture and a "type instead" text field. | P0 | D4 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-051 | The rule list offers search, filters (profile, mode, app, state), conflict and problem badges with text, multi-select enable/disable, duplicate, delete with undo, and export. | P0 | D4 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-052 | The GUI never shows a rule as saved or active before the engine has loaded it; drafts, saved and active states are distinct. | P0 | D4 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-053 | Korean and English labels; the editor renders Hangul and emoji correctly. | P1 | D4 | M |

### 2.7 Headless, hotkey contract and integration

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DDALGAK-FR-060 | `ddalgak` follows the Kim CLI contract for `rule`, `profile`, `mode`, `test`, `explain`, `status`, `pause`, `resume`, `engine`, `hotkeys` and `capabilities`, with `--json`. No CLI command opens a window or tray icon, starts the app or installs a hook. | P0 | D6 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-061 | Ddalgak conforms to the hotkey contract: its manifest ([example](contracts/examples/kim-hotkey-manifest-v1/ddalgak.json)), `hotkeys.json`, the `hotkeys` commands, rule triggers listed as read-only `rule.<id>` actions and `hook_overrides_global` reported ([HOTKEY_CONTRACT §13.4](HOTKEY_CONTRACT.md)). | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-062 | An opt-in local MCP adapter offers read-only inspection, explain and simulation; changes need explicitly granted permissions. It cannot turn the engine on, run live tests or grant consent. | P2 | D6 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-063 | An AutoHotkey v2 importer previews and converts a declarative subset into disabled rules with a line-by-line coverage report; it never executes or evaluates the script. Step 80: implemented (`ddalgak profile import file.ahk`, the editor's *Import profile…*; ADR 0081, [migration guide](DDALGAK_AHK_MIGRATION.md)). | P2 | D5 | T |

### 2.8 Later capabilities (tracked)

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DDALGAK-FR-070 | Hotstrings: typed abbreviations as triggers, with word boundaries, case options and replacement, never in password fields and without keeping typing history. | P1 | D3 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-071 | Mouse buttons as triggers (needs a low-level mouse hook, disclosed in the catalog before it ships). Step 68: the middle and X buttons, through a mouse hook that exists only while such a rule is active; the primary and secondary buttons are never triggers (ADR 0031). | P1 | D3 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-072 | Window actions (activate, minimize, maximize, move, resize) under the `window-control` permission. Step 79: implemented (ADR 0080; never elevated or locked-session windows). | P2 | D5 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-073 | Clipboard actions (set, paste, transform) under the `clipboard` permission, never logging contents. Step 79: implemented (set, clear, transform; paste is `type_text` paste). | P2 | D5 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-074 | Macro recorder: explicit start and stop with a visible banner, password fields and secure contexts excluded, every recorded event reviewable and removable before saving. Step 78: implemented in the editor, recording only keys typed into its own window (ADR 0079); mouse recording: #101. | P2 | D5 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-FR-075 | Richer macro control: bounded repeat, conditions and variables, with timeouts and cancellation. | P2 | D5 | T |
| DDALGAK-FR-076 | Scheduled and time-based triggers in a running app, with an idle budget and no hidden timers. Step 79: implemented (`trigger.schedule`; one deadline per scheduled rule, none without; missed times skipped). | P2 | D5 | T, M |

## 3. Non-functional requirements

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DDALGAK-NFR-001 | **Idle cost.** With the engine running, 100 rules and no input, the app averages < 0.1 % of one core over 60 s and has no periodic timers; with the engine off it holds no hook. | P0 | D6 | M |
| DDALGAK-NFR-002 | **Hook latency.** The hook callback returns in < 1 ms (p99) for any key, matched or not; matching side effects run on a worker thread. The engine never relies on the system's `LowLevelHooksTimeout` (at most 1000 ms on Windows 10 1709 and later). | P0 | D2 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-NFR-003 | **Memory.** Tray app with the engine running and no window open: < 25 MB working set; editor open: < 80 MB. | P1 | D6 | M |
| DDALGAK-NFR-004 | **Load time.** Loading and validating 1000 rules and installing the hook takes < 100 ms on a typical machine. | P1 | D2 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-NFR-005 | **Portable rules.** Stored keys use the contract's names, never virtual-key numbers; paths may use known-folder tokens; the file is UTF-8 JSON. | P0 | D2 | T, I |
| DDALGAK-NFR-006 | **Layouts and IME.** Logical, physical and character keys behave as in [HOTKEY_CONTRACT §6](HOTKEY_CONTRACT.md); no rule fires during an IME composition; typed text is independent of the active layout. Verified with the US layout and Korean 2-set IME. | P0 | D3 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-NFR-007 | **Accessibility.** The editor and playground are fully keyboard-operable, announce captured keys and errors to screen readers and meet `KIM-NFR-012`. | P0 | D4 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-NFR-008 | **Contract stability.** The rules and simulation documents carry schema versions; additive changes keep v1; a newer file is read-only; migrations are pure `vN → vN+1` steps behind a backup. | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-NFR-009 | **Linux is not claimed** before D7; the X11 and Wayland differences are documented ([DDALGAK_SAFETY §9](DDALGAK_SAFETY.md)). | P0 | D2 | I |
| DDALGAK-NFR-010 | **Reliability.** No handle, thread or hook leak over a 72-hour run with periodic profile switches, pauses and reloads. | P1 | D6 | M |

## 4. Security, privacy and safety

| ID | Requirement | Pri | MS | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DDALGAK-SEC-001 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE. No keylogging.** The hook inspects each event only to decide whether a rule matches. Keys and text are never stored, logged, transmitted or shown in diagnostics; the activity list records rule IDs, outcome codes and times only. | P0 | D2 | I, T |
| DDALGAK-SEC-002 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE. Secure desktop and password fields.** Ddalgak never intercepts or injects on the secure desktop (Ctrl+Alt+Del, UAC, sign-in, lock screen). In a password field it steps aside: rules are skipped and keys pass unchanged; text is never typed into one; the recorder never records one. | P0 | D2 | I, T, M |
| DDALGAK-SEC-003 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE. Emergency off.** `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Escape` is detected on physical key state before any rule, cannot be remapped, hidden or produced by a rule, and within one key event removes the hook, releases every key and button Ddalgak holds, cancels runs and turns the engine off. It works with an invalid or conflicting configuration. | P0 | D2 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-SEC-004 | **No recursion.** Ddalgak's own injected input never triggers a rule; a rule that accepts other programs' injected input never injects input; a rule whose output is its own trigger is refused; each rule is rate-limited and a run-away loop through another program is stopped with `rate_limited`. | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-SEC-005 | **No stuck keys.** Every key or button Ddalgak presses is released: on trigger release, pause, turn-off, emergency, profile or mode switch, session lock or switch to the secure desktop, a failing run and process exit. A consumed key-down always has its key-up consumed too. | P0 | D3 | T, M |
| DDALGAK-SEC-006 | **Explicit consent per permission.** `input-injection`, `launch-programs` (bound to a fingerprint of the exact targets) and `clipboard` each need consent recorded on the rule, given in the GUI or with `--allow <permission>`. Consent is never imported and never granted by an agent. | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-SEC-007 | **No elevation or privileged components.** No administrator rights, `UIAccess`, service, driver or SYSTEM process. Injecting rules are skipped while an elevated window has focus (`skipped_elevated_target`), and the GUI explains why. | P0 | D2 | I, M |
| DDALGAK-SEC-008 | **Launch safety.** Programs start with `CreateProcess` and an argument list, never a shell string; command interpreters and script hosts are refused; URLs are `http`/`https` only and carry no credentials; nothing requests elevation; a missing target is reported, never searched for. | P0 | D3 | T, I |
| DDALGAK-SEC-009 | **Reserved chords.** Triggers never use OS-reserved, IME, emergency, `Alt+F4` or global `F12` chords; outputs never produce the Secure Attention Sequence or the emergency chord; `Win` chords are not triggers in v1. | P0 | D2 | T |
| DDALGAK-SEC-010 | **A visible hook.** The hook runs only inside `ddalgak-gui.exe` started by the user (or by opt-in sign-in start), with its tray icon showing the engine state. No headless path creates a hook or a tray icon. | P0 | D2 | I, T |
| DDALGAK-SEC-011 | **Private rule content.** Typed text, URLs, paths and arguments never appear in logs, activity entries or simulation output beyond the summaries of [RULE_MODEL §11](DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL.md); rule files are readable by the user only. | P0 | D2 | T, I |
| DDALGAK-SEC-012 | **Anti-cheat honesty.** Ddalgak never hides itself, never evades or bypasses anti-cheat or input protection, and installs no kernel component. Documentation says that games may ignore or forbid synthetic input and that using Ddalgak in such games is the user's decision. | P0 | D3 | D, I |
| DDALGAK-SEC-013 | **Imported profiles are untrusted.** They arrive disabled and without consent; each launch target and injecting rule is reviewed before it can be enabled. | P0 | D4 | T |
| DDALGAK-SEC-014 | **No network.** Ddalgak opens no network connection; "open a website" only hands the URL to the default browser. | P0 | D2 | I, T |

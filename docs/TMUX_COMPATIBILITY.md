# tmux Compatibility Matrix

Status: **current** (inventory) · Reference: tmux 3.8 · Matrix version: 1 (2026-11-03) · Owner:
mouv · Tracks [SUBAK-FR-060](PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md)

> **Only the session basics are implemented, partially** (Step 10: named Terminals in the Host;
> Step 11: pane programs and environment; Step 12: the CLI `subak new|ls|info|status|attach|
> detach|rename|stop|kill|rm`; Step 13: scrollback, replay, `capture`, `clear-history`,
> `--history-limit`; Step 15: mouse reports, wheel, word and line selection and focus events in
> the client view; Step 21: internal windows and panes, `subak window|pane` and their IPC
> methods). 11 rows are `implemented` and 42 are `partial`, all with
> automated evidence; every other row is `planned`, `deferred` or `unsupported`. This document
> is an inventory and a plan, not a compatibility claim. Step 19 added the Subak window's own
> search, keyboard selection and clipboard (SUBAK_GUI §12): they are not tmux's copy mode (Step
> 24), which will drive the same headless search engine and view selection with tmux's keys.

## 0. How to read this matrix

**Reference.** The inventory follows the official tmux manual page of the **tmux 3.8 release**
(git tag `3.8`, commit `7f2a35ad3321f9ba57a1062ca73b1f3ff26aca53`; `tmux.1` revision 1.1173,
`$Mdocdate: September 23 2026`), fetched from
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmux/tmux/3.8/tmux.1>. Where the manual page is incomplete,
the same tag's sources were used: commands and aliases from `cmd-*.c` (92 commands), default
key bindings from `key-bindings.c`, option names from `options-table.c`. tmux `master` at commit `a73616d781f2` (2026-10-30) was also read; its
unreleased changes are listed in §24 and are **not** part of the matrix.

**Terms.** Subak's object model is Terminal → internal Window → Pane → process
([SUBAK_PHILOSOPHY.md](SUBAK_PHILOSOPHY.md) §2). A Subak **Terminal** is a tmux **session** and
appears as one GUI tab. A Subak internal **Window** is a tmux **window**; it is *not* a GUI tab.

**Columns.**

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| tmux feature | What tmux does, in a few words |
| tmux reference | Command (alias), key, option, format or syntax, as in tmux 3.8 |
| Subak equivalent (planned) | How Subak intends to provide it; for `deferred`/`unsupported` the *Rationale* |
| Status | One of the five values below |
| Target Step | Step issue expected to deliver it (`10, 12` = Host part in 10, CLI part in 12) |
| Evidence | Automated test name/path and date (see §26); `—` until then |

**Status values.** `planned` — intended, not built · `partial` — some documented behaviour has
automated evidence · `implemented` — the whole row has automated evidence · `deferred` — not
planned before Step 26; may be revisited · `unsupported` — will not be provided, by design.
`implemented` is used since Step 11 (four environment rows) and Step 12 (invocation, `has-session`, `new -d`); Step 13 made six scrollback rows `partial`; Step 15 made five client-view rows `partial`; Step 21 made `rename-window` `implemented` and ten window and pane rows `partial`.

**Target Steps.**

| Step | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| 10 | Session/Terminal CRUD in the Host |
| 11 | Pane programs and their environment ([PTY_PROCESSES](PTY_PROCESSES.md)) |
| 12 | Subak CLI: `new`, `ls`, `info`, `attach`, `detach`, `rename`, `kill`, `host status` |
| 13 | Scrollback and replay (`capture-pane`, `clear-history`) |
| 21 | Internal Windows and Panes (create, list, select, rename, kill) |
| 22 | Splitting and layout (split, resize, swap, zoom, rotate, basic layouts) |
| 23 | Prefix and key-binding engine; default key table; `Ctrl+B Ctrl+B` literal prefix |
| 24 | Command prompt, target syntax, copy mode, paste buffers, join/break-pane, detach |
| 25 | Advanced: layout presets, linked windows, synchronize-panes, command chains, hooks, options, status line, alerts, `switch-client`, `if-shell`/`run-shell`, `display-panes`, `choose-tree`, environment, `source-file` |
| 26 | Full validation and the published compatibility statement |
| post-26 | Deferred; no Step assigned |

**Conventions.** "Host op" = an operation of the Host's IPC API (Step 10), later exposed by the
CLI and GUI. "CLI verb TBD" = the CLI spelling is decided in the listed Step; fixed names are the Step 12
verbs above and the Step 13 verbs `subak capture`, `subak history` and `subak clear-history` (ADR 0030). Keys written `Ctrl+B x` are Subak GUI keys; `C-b x` are tmux keys.
"tmux-syntax commands" = tmux command lines accepted by Subak's prompt (`Ctrl+B :`) and by
`source-file`; a CLI entry point for them is TBD.

## 1. Invocation (`tmux` command-line flags)

| tmux feature | tmux reference | Subak equivalent (planned) | Status | Target Step | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Run a command against the running server | `tmux <command> [flags]` | `subak <verb>` CLI with human and `--json` output (KIM-FR-010). *Partial:* `subak new\|ls\|info\|status\|attach\|detach\|rename\|stop\|kill\|rm` ([SUBAK_CLI](SUBAK_CLI.md)); a tmux-syntax entry point later (Steps 24–25) | partial | 12 | `crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs::every_command_answers_one_schema_valid_document_with_stable_exit_codes` (2026-11-04) |
| Run the default command when none is given | `tmux` (no args) → `default-client-command` (`new-session`) | *Rationale:* nothing starts implicitly (ADR 0027 §2): bare `subak` prints help; `subak new --attach` is the explicit equivalent | unsupported | — | — |
| Shortest unambiguous command prefix | e.g. `tmux list-se` | Accepted by the tmux-syntax parser (prompt, `source-file`) | planned | 24 | — |
| Force 256 colours | `-2` | Always full colour in the GUI; no flag needed | planned | 12 | — |
| UTF-8 output | `-u` | Always UTF-8 (KIM-NFR-013); no flag needed. *Partial:* the CLI's output and `--json` are UTF-8, and `attach` switches its console to code page 65001 and restores it; the GUI later | partial | 12 | `crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs::console_attach_restores_the_console_on_every_exit_path_it_survives` (2026-11-04) |
| Control mode | `-C`, `-CC` | *Rationale:* control mode is deferred (§19); Subak's own IPC and `--json` CLI serve integrations | deferred | post-26 | — |
| Run a shell command as a login shell | `-c shell-command` | *Rationale:* tmux-as-login-shell has no Windows analogue | unsupported | — | — |
| Behave as a login shell | `-l` | *Rationale:* no-op compatibility flag for login shells; no Windows analogue | unsupported | — | — |
| Do not daemonize the server | `-D` | `subak host` in the foreground for debugging (flag TBD) | planned | 10 | — |
| Alternative configuration file | `-f file` | Subak config path option (TBD); a tmux-syntax file is read with `source-file` | planned | 25 | — |
| Help | `-h` | `subak --help` (KIM-FR-011) | implemented | 12 | `crates/subak/tests/cli.rs::help_is_honest_about_the_prototype_status` (2026-11-04) |
| Named or explicit server socket | `-L socket-name`, `-S socket-path` | *Rationale:* no socket compatibility; one Host per user over local, same-user IPC (SUBAK-SEC-010) | unsupported | — | — |
| Do not start the server | `-N` | `subak new --no-start` never starts the Host (`host_not_running` instead); every other command never starts one | implemented | 12 | `crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs::every_command_answers_one_schema_valid_document_with_stable_exit_codes` (2026-11-04) |
| Declare outer-terminal features | `-T features` | *Rationale:* applies to an outer terminal; the GUI renders natively. Revisit if a console-rendering client is built | deferred | post-26 | — |
| Print version | `-V` | `subak --version` | implemented | 12 | `crates/subak/tests/cli.rs::version_prints_package_version_and_succeeds` (2026-11-04) |
| Verbose logging | `-v`, `-vv` | `--verbose` (KIM-FR-011); local Host log without terminal content (KIM-SEC-012). *Partial:* `-v` adds client diagnostics on stderr (endpoint, error codes, the key records an attach reads); the Host log later | partial | 12 | `crates/subak/tests/conpty_host.rs::console_attach_sends_raw_keys_and_follows_window_resizes` (2026-11-04) |
| Exit status and error messages | exit codes, `no server running`, etc. | Documented exit codes and stable error codes (KIM-FR-011; [CLI_CONTRACT §5–§6](CLI_CONTRACT.md), `subak-cli-v1`) | implemented | 12 | `crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs::every_command_answers_one_schema_valid_document_with_stable_exit_codes` (2026-11-04) |

## 2. Commands (all 92, with aliases)

Grouped by the manual page section that documents them. `set-window-option` and
`show-window-options` are registered in `cmd-*.c` but no longer documented in `tmux.1`.

### 2.1 Clients and sessions

| tmux feature | tmux reference | Subak equivalent (planned) | Status | Target Step | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attach a client to a session | `attach-session` (`attach`) | `subak attach <terminal>`; GUI opens or focuses the Terminal's tab. *Partial:* `subak attach [<terminal>]` with `-r` as `--read-only` (Step 12); `subak-gui [<terminal>]` shows the Host's Terminals as tabs and opens that one (Steps 16–17, [SUBAK_GUI](SUBAK_GUI.md)); `-d` later | partial | 12, 16, 17 | `crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs::a_user_creates_attaches_detaches_lists_renames_and_kills_with_the_cli_only` (2026-11-04), `crates/subak/tests/gui_window.rs::the_window_opens_an_existing_terminal_and_types_into_its_process_without_a_new_shell` (2026-11-04) |

| Kill a session | `kill-session` | Host delete op; `subak kill <terminal>` with `--dry-run` and `--force` (SUBAK-FR-014). *Partial:* `terminal.kill` and `subak kill <terminal>` (`--dry-run`, consent or `--yes`; busy Terminals need it); GUI `Ctrl+W` (Step 17: by id, asks when busy); `-a`, `-C` not yet | partial | 10, 12, 17 | `crates/subak/tests/session_lifecycle.rs::stop_kill_and_rm_have_distinct_explicit_guarded_meanings`, `crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs::a_user_creates_attaches_detaches_lists_renames_and_kills_with_the_cli_only` (2026-11-04), `crates/subak/tests/gui_window.rs::ctrl_t_creates_and_ctrl_w_closes_asking_first_when_busy_never_hitting_another_terminal` (Step 17) |
| List clients | `list-clients` (`lsc`) | `subak host status` lists attached clients. *Partial:* `subak status` and `subak host status` list every client with its id, kind, pid and attachments; `-F`/`-t` not yet | partial | 12 | `crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs::a_user_creates_attaches_detaches_lists_renames_and_kills_with_the_cli_only` (2026-11-04) |
| List commands | `list-commands` (`lscm`) | List supported tmux-syntax commands with usage | planned | 24 | — |
| List sessions | `list-sessions` (`ls`) | `subak ls` (human and `--json`; SUBAK-FR-012). *Partial:* `subak ls` (human and `--json`); Claude status (Step 28) and `-F`/`-f` not yet | partial | 12 | `crates/subak/tests/session_lifecycle.rs::zero_one_and_many_terminals_have_isolated_process_trees`, `crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs::every_command_answers_one_schema_valid_document_with_stable_exit_codes` (2026-11-04) |
| Lock a client | `lock-client` (`lockc`) | *Rationale:* the OS lock screen protects the desktop; Subak never locks a session | unsupported | — | — |
| Lock the server | `lock-server` (`lock`) | *Rationale:* as `lock-client` | unsupported | — | — |
| Lock a session | `lock-session` (`locks`) | *Rationale:* as `lock-client` | unsupported | — | — |
| Create a session | `new-session` (`new`) | Host create op from a profile; `subak new` and GUI `Ctrl+T` (SUBAK-FR-011). *Partial:* `terminal.create` and `subak new [<name>] [-- <command> \| --command-line <line>]`; GUI `Ctrl+T` (Step 17, the Host's default shell); profiles (Step 33) not yet | partial | 10, 12, 17 | `crates/subak/tests/session_lifecycle.rs::zero_one_and_many_terminals_have_isolated_process_trees`, `crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs::a_user_creates_attaches_detaches_lists_renames_and_kills_with_the_cli_only` (2026-11-04) |

| Rename a session | `rename-session` (`rename`) | Host rename op; `subak rename` and GUI tab rename. *Partial:* `terminal.rename` and `subak rename` (also while clients are attached); GUI rename in place (`Ctrl+Shift+R`, a double click; Step 17) | partial | 10, 12, 17 | `crates/subak/tests/session_lifecycle.rs::names_are_unique_ignoring_case_and_composition_and_renames_keep_ids`, `crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs::a_user_creates_attaches_detaches_lists_renames_and_kills_with_the_cli_only` (2026-11-04) |
| Grant other users access | `server-access` | *Rationale:* the Host is per-user by design; IPC is restricted to the same user (SUBAK-SEC-010) | unsupported | — | — |
| Show the message log | `show-messages` (`showmsgs`) | Host message log, local only | planned | 25 | — |
| Run commands from a file | `source-file` (`source`) | Parse a tmux-syntax file (§17) | planned | 25 | — |
| Start the server | `start-server` (`start`) | The Host starts on demand (SUBAK-FR-002); explicit start verb TBD. *Partial:* `subak new` starts it on demand and `subak host start` explicitly | partial | 10 | `crates/subak/tests/session_lifecycle.rs::exits_restarts_and_reconnects_leave_no_stale_state` (2026-11-04) |
| Suspend a client | `suspend-client` (`suspendc`) | *Rationale:* no SIGTSTP or job control on Windows; minimizing the GUI is the analogue | unsupported | — | — |

## 4. Default key bindings: prefix table (`C-b`)

Complete list from `key-bindings.c` of tmux 3.8 (the manual page lists only part of it). Keys in
the basic table of SUBAK-FR-033 are marked *basic*. A key can only work once the Step 23 engine
exists, so no key row targets a Step before 23.

## 5. Default key bindings: root table (mouse)

The root table has no default keyboard bindings; all defaults are mouse events and take effect
when `mouse` is on.

| tmux feature | tmux reference | Subak equivalent (planned) | Status | Target Step | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Click focuses a pane; forwarded if the app uses the mouse | `MouseDown1Pane` → `select-pane -t=; send -M` | Click focuses the Pane; mouse reporting forwarded when the program requests it. *Partial:* the client view encodes the program's mouse reports for every tracking mode and encoding, and Shift keeps the mouse for selection ([TERMINAL_EMULATOR §4.3](TERMINAL_EMULATOR.md)); the window (Step 16) and focusing split panes (Step 22) are later | partial | 15, 22 | `crates/subak-term/tests/view.rs::the_view_routes_the_mouse_to_the_program_or_to_selection_and_scrolling` (2026-11-04) |

| Wheel up scrolls history | `WheelUpPane` → `copy-mode -e` (or `send -M`) | Wheel scrolls scrollback; forwarded in the alternate screen or when the program uses the mouse. *Partial:* the client view scrolls its viewport over the Host's history, forwards the wheel to programs that track the mouse and sends cursor keys on the alternate screen when the program enables alternate scroll (1007); the window that delivers the wheel is Step 16 | partial | 13, 15 | `crates/subak-term/tests/view.rs::the_view_routes_the_mouse_to_the_program_or_to_selection_and_scrolling` (2026-11-04) |
| Middle-click pastes | `MouseDown2Pane` → `paste -p` | Middle-click pastes the latest buffer | planned | 24 | — |
| Double-click copies a word | `DoubleClick1Pane` → `select-word; copy-pipe-and-cancel` | Same gesture. *Partial:* word selection and its copy text in the client view (Windows Terminal's word delimiters, wide characters once); the gesture and the clipboard are the GUI's (Step 16; plain text and, on request, HTML Format since Step 19), which copies on an explicit copy rather than on the click (copy-on-select is off, Step 20 adds the option) | partial | 15, 24 | `crates/subak-term/tests/view.rs::word_and_block_selection` (2026-11-04) |

## 23. Subak-specific differences

- **GUI tabs are Terminals, not tmux windows.** One GUI tab = one Terminal = one tmux session.
  `Ctrl+B c` creates an internal Window *inside* the current tab; internal Windows are listed in
  the tab (status line, Step 25), never as extra GUI tabs.
- **GUI-level shortcuts sit in front of the prefix table.** `Ctrl+T` (new Terminal),
  `Ctrl+W` (close = delete the Terminal, confirmed when busy) and `Ctrl+Tab` /
  `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` (next/previous tab) are Subak GUI shortcuts with no tmux binding
  (SUBAK-FR-033). Their nearest tmux analogues are `new-session`, `kill-session` and
  `switch-client -n`/`-p`. All are rebindable (SUBAK-FR-034).
- **Shadowed keys pass through via the prefix.** `Ctrl+B Ctrl+W`, `Ctrl+B Ctrl+T` (and
  `Ctrl+B Ctrl+Tab`) send the literal shadowed key to the program (readline, Vim), as decided in
  ADR 0009 (SUBAK-FR-034). tmux leaves these prefix keys unbound, so no tmux binding is lost.
  `Ctrl+B Ctrl+B` sends a literal `Ctrl+B`, exactly like tmux `send-prefix`.
- **The Host is not a tmux server.** There is no socket or protocol compatibility: no `-L`/`-S`,
  no `TMUX_TMPDIR`, no socket path in the marker variable, and the real `tmux` binary cannot
  attach to a Subak Host (or the reverse). tmux muscle memory carries over through the key
  tables; tmux scripts carry over through tmux-syntax commands (prompt, `source-file`, CLI form
  TBD).
- **Persistence goes further than tmux.** tmux sessions die with the server. The Subak Host
  persists structure and offers restore after a reboot, with new processes marked `restored`
  (SUBAK-FR-040…043). tmux has no built-in equivalent.
- **IDs are stronger.** tmux `$n`/`@n`/`%n` are unique for one server's life; Subak IDs are
  stable and never reused (SUBAK-FR-010).
- **Windows, not POSIX.** No SIGHUP, SIGTSTP or tty names; panes run under ConPTY with
  Job Objects (SUBAK-FR-016). Shell commands (`if-shell`, `run-shell`, `#()`, `copy-pipe`) run in
  the profile shell, so quoting differs from `/bin/sh`.
- **Closing vs killing is the same as tmux for panes and windows** (`Ctrl+B x`, `Ctrl+B &` kill
  processes), but closing the GUI is always a detach (SUBAK-FR-015).
- **Killing the last window or pane never ends the Terminal** (Step 21, ADR 0054). tmux's
  `kill-window` or `kill-pane` of a session's last one ends the session; Subak refuses it
  (`invalid_state`, `last_window`/`last_pane`) because only `subak kill` (or the GUI's guarded
  `Ctrl+W`) ends a Terminal. Kills from the CLI always ask (or need `--yes`) and act on the
  confirmed id; the Host refuses a busy pane without `force`.
- **The selection is shared, per Terminal** (Step 21), as tmux's current window is per session;
  every client sees the same active window and pane and the GUI follows it. A `subak attach` stays
  on the pane it attached to (tmux would switch the client).
- **Subak-only features** such as the Claude indicator (SUBAK-FR-050) have no tmux row.

## 24. Unreleased changes on tmux master (not counted)

Seen at `master` commit `a73616d781f2` (`tmux.1` revision 1.1195, 2026-10-29) and **not** in 3.8.
They get rows only once released:

- `display-popup` (`popup`) and the `popup-style`, `popup-border-style`, `popup-border-lines`
  options are removed from the manual page (floating panes take over that role).
- New options: `image-size-limit`, `image-total-count-limit`, `image-total-size-limit`, `utmp`,
  `side-status`, `side-status-format`, `side-status-style`, `side-status-width`,
  `copy-mode-keep-column`, `window-default-command`; a new `nl` list entry.
- The list of layout names is restructured in the manual page.

## 25. Related decisions and open inputs

Rows follow the Step 03 decision records in `docs/adr/`: ADR 0007 (IDs, names, targets),
ADR 0008 (attach, replay, size arbitration) and ADR 0009 (GUI keyboard dispatch and
pass-through). Still open: the CLI contract (Step 07) and the Kim design system (Step 04).
Rows that say "TBD" are updated when those land.

## 26. How evidence is recorded

- **Format.** An Evidence cell lists one or more automated tests and the date they first
  passed, e.g. `e2e/tests/step21_windows.rs::new_window_creates_internal_window (2027-01-15)` or
  a unit/integration test path plus test name. Dates are ISO 8601.
- **`implemented` needs automated evidence** that exercises the tmux-visible behaviour of the
  whole row (command, flags named in the row, key, or option effect). A manual check alone is
  never enough; it can support `partial` at most, and must say *manual* with steps.
- **`partial`** names what is covered in the Subak column (e.g. "`-h`, `-v` only").
- **Traceability.** Tests cite SUBAK-FR-060 and the tmux reference of the row in their doc
  comment (see the e2e conventions in [e2e/LEDGER.md](../e2e/LEDGER.md)).
- **Same-change updates.** Changing a Status updates Evidence and §27 in the same commit.
- **Reference upgrades.** Moving to a newer tmux release bumps the matrix version, adds new rows
  as `planned` (or `deferred`/`unsupported` with a rationale), and marks rows for removed tmux
  features. Step 26 re-validates every row and publishes the compatibility statement.

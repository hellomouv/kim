Status: **current** (implemented in Step 12; `capture`, `history`, `clear-history` and
`new --history-limit` in Step 13; `hotkeys` in Step 17; `window` and `pane` in Step 21; Windows only, Linux with M4 — the
`hotkeys` commands are portable) · Decisions:

`subak` is the headless command line of Subak, the persistent terminal. Every command is a
short-lived client of your per-user **Host**, which owns the **Terminals** (named workspaces,
each with one window and one pane until Steps 21–22) and their processes. Closing, detaching or
killing a client never stops anything in the Host. What a Terminal is, its states and what each
verb does to processes are in [SESSION_MODEL.md](SESSION_MODEL.md); what runs in a pane is in
[PTY_PROCESSES.md](PTY_PROCESSES.md); what the Host keeps of their output, and how a reattach
reproduces it, is in [SCROLLBACK.md](SCROLLBACK.md); the wire protocol is
[IPC_PROTOCOL.md](contracts/IPC_PROTOCOL.md).

Pre-alpha: there is no split, no persistence and no recovery yet; the window is the separate
program `subak-gui` ([SUBAK_GUI](SUBAK_GUI.md); Terminals as tabs since Step 17), which no `subak`
command starts. No command opens a
window, installs anything or uses the network, and the Host listens only on a local named pipe
that only your user can open.

## 1. Commands at a glance

| Command | Effect | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `subak new [<name>] [-- <program> [args…] \| --command-line <line>]` | write | Create a Terminal; starts a Host on demand |
| `subak ls` (also `list`) | read | Every Terminal with state, pid and clients |
| `subak status` | read | The Host (or that none runs), every Terminal, every client |
| `subak info <target>` | read | One Terminal with its windows and panes; exit 3 if none |
| `subak attach [<target>]` | write | Connect this terminal to a Terminal's pane |
| `subak detach [<target>] [--client <id>]` | write | Detach clients from outside; stops nothing |
| `subak rename <target> <new-name>` | write | Rename; the id never changes |
| `subak stop <target>` | destructive | End the processes, keep the Terminal as `stopped` |
| `subak kill <target>` | destructive | End the processes at once and remove the Terminal |
| `subak rm <target> [--force]` | destructive | Remove a Terminal that runs nothing |
| `subak capture [<target>]` (also `capture-pane`) | read | Lines of the screen and history the Host keeps; secrets shown as `***` |
| `subak history [<target>]` | read | How much output the Host keeps (counters and limits, never content) |
| `subak clear-history [<target>]` | destructive | Delete the kept history; the screen stays |
| `subak window new\|ls\|select\|rename\|kill`, `subak pane new\|ls\|select\|kill` (also `new-window`, `list-windows`, `select-window`, `rename-window`, `kill-window`, `list-panes`, `select-pane`, `kill-pane`) | write / read / destructive | A Terminal's internal windows and panes ([§3.14](#314-windows-and-panes-subak-window--subak-pane-)) |
| `subak host start\|status\|health\|attach\|stop\|serve` | — | The Host itself ([§3.11](#311-the-host-subak-host-)) |
| `subak hotkeys list\|show\|set\|disable\|enable\|reset\|check\|export\|import` | read / write | The window's keyboard shortcuts ([§3.12](#312-keyboard-shortcuts-subak-hotkeys-)); never contacts a Host |
| `subak config show\|check\|set\|reset\|export\|import`, `subak profile list\|show` | read / write | Settings and shell profiles in `config.toml` ([§3.13](#313-settings-and-shell-profiles-subak-config--subak-profile-)); never contacts a Host |
| `subak capabilities` | read | The machine-readable command list (CLI_CONTRACT §9) |

**Structure.** The Terminal verbs are top level and named like tmux's
([TMUX_COMPATIBILITY](TMUX_COMPATIBILITY.md)). `subak terminal new|list|ls|info|rename|attach|
stop|kill|rm` (Steps 10–11) still works as a **deprecated alias**: same command, same options,
same output and command name, plus a warning (`warnings` in `--json`, one stderr line otherwise).
Bare `subak` prints help; nothing starts implicitly.

**Targets** are a Terminal name (exact, ignoring case and Unicode composition) or its id
(`t-` + 12 hex digits). `attach`, `detach`, `capture`, `history`, `clear-history` and the `window`
and `pane` commands also take `<terminal>:<window>[.<pane>]` and window or pane ids
([SESSION_MODEL §3](SESSION_MODEL.md)); each `window`/`pane` command takes exactly one level.

**Endpoints.** Every command except `hotkeys`, `config` and `profile` takes `--endpoint <name>`; the default is your per-user,
per-Windows-session pipe `\\.\pipe\mouv-subak-<SID>-s<session>`. Use your own name for
experiments: it never touches the default Host.

## 2. Output, exit codes, consent

The rules of [CLI_CONTRACT.md](CLI_CONTRACT.md) apply to every command:

- Results on **stdout**, notices and errors on **stderr**. `--json` prints exactly one document on
  stdout, also for failures (the `data` of each command is typed by
  [subak-cli-v1](contracts/schemas/subak-cli-v1.schema.json); examples from real runs are in
  [contracts/examples/subak-cli-v1/](contracts/examples/subak-cli-v1/)). `attach` streams the
  terminal, so `--json` works there only with `--dry-run`.
- **Exit codes**: 0 ok · 1 I/O, internal, `spawn_failed` · 2 usage, `invalid_name`,
  `ambiguous_target` · 3 `host_not_running`, `target_not_found` · 4 `protocol_error`,
  `host_identity_mismatch` · 5 `unsupported_platform`, `host_too_old|new` · 6
  `host_disconnected`, `host_unresponsive`, `timeout` · 7 `host_already_running`,
  `name_conflict`, `invalid_state`, `terminals_running`, `confirmation_required` · 8 `cancelled`.
  `error.exit_code` always equals the process exit code; the registry is
  [CLI_CONTRACT §6](CLI_CONTRACT.md).
- **Destructive** commands (`stop`, `kill`, `rm`, `host stop`) ask on the terminal, or need
  `--yes`. They never ask — and fail with `confirmation_required` (exit 7) — with `--json`,
  `--no-input`, the environment variable `KIM_NO_INPUT` (any value but empty, `0`, `false`), or
  when stdin or stderr is not a terminal. `--dry-run` shows the plan and changes nothing.
- **Secrets** never appear: `--env NAME=VALUE` values are used once and never shown (outputs name
  the variables only); secret-looking arguments (`--token=…`, the value after `--password`) and
  words of a verbatim command line are shown as `***` ([CLI_CONTRACT §10](CLI_CONTRACT.md)).
- `-q` suppresses notices and warnings, `-v` adds diagnostics (endpoint, error codes) on stderr.

## 3. Command reference

### 3.1 `subak new`

```text
subak new [<name>] [--cwd <dir>] [--env NAME[=VALUE]]... [--unset-env NAME]...
          [--size <cols>x<rows>] [--remain-on-exit] [--keep-on-failure] [--no-start]
          [--history-limit <lines>] [--profile <name> | --no-profile]
          [--attach [--read-only]] [--dry-run] [--json]
          [-- <program> [args...] | --command-line <line>]
```

Creates a Terminal and returns at once (detached, like `tmux new -d`); `--attach` attaches this
terminal right after. Without a name it gets the lowest free number (`1`, `2`, …); a name in use
(ignoring case) is refused with `name_conflict`, never suffixed.

- **Host on demand.** If no Host serves the endpoint, `new` starts one (detached, with your logon
  environment, owning no Terminal of its own) under the per-endpoint start lock, so concurrent
  `new` calls share one Host (measured with 6 at once). `--no-start` never starts one and fails
  with `host_not_running` instead (tmux `-N`).
- **Program.** `-- <program> [args…]` runs the program with every argument as one word, quoted for
  Windows, never through a shell; a bare name is looked up on the pane's `PATH`. Batch and
  PowerShell scripts are refused with a hint to name their interpreter. `--command-line <line>`
  passes one verbatim line instead ([§6](#6-verbatim-command-lines)). Default: `%ComSpec%`.
- `--cwd` (absolute; default your profile folder), `--env NAME=VALUE`, `--env NAME` (copies this
  terminal's value, so a token is never typed), `--unset-env NAME`, `--size` (default 120x30),
  `--remain-on-exit` (keep it as `stopped` when its program exits), `--keep-on-failure` (keep a
  failed start as `failed`), `--history-limit` (history rows the Host keeps for the pane,
  0–100 000, default 2 000; tmux `history-limit`).
- `--dry-run` makes every check the real run makes (name, working directory, program on the
  pane's `PATH`, scripts) and reports the resolved `executable`; without a Host it starts none.
- `--profile <name>` (Step 20) starts a shell profile of `config.toml`; without a program `new`
  uses the default profile unless `--no-profile` ([§3.13](#313-settings-and-shell-profiles-subak-config--subak-profile-)).

```console
> subak new build -- cmd.exe /d
Terminal `build` (t-3633c7e09d6d) created: pid 61928 (C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe); started Host pid 62452
attach with: subak attach t-3633c7e09d6d
> subak new api --cwd C:\src\api --env RUST_LOG=debug --env GITHUB_TOKEN -- cargo run
> subak new dev --attach
```

`--json`: the `terminal.create` result (`terminal_id`, `window_id`, `pane_id`, `name`, the whole
`terminal`) plus `host: {pid, started}`; a dry run is `{dry_run, would_create, would_start_host}`.

### 3.2 `subak ls`

Every Terminal in creation order: id, name, state, pid, attached clients, program, `(busy)` when
it runs more than an idle shell. Without a Host it lists nothing (exit 0) and starts nothing.
`--json`: `{terminals: [summary…], host: {pid} | null}`.

```console
> subak ls
ID              NAME                  STATE         PID  CLIENTS  PROGRAM
t-3633c7e09d6d  build                 running     61928        0  C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe
```

### 3.3 `subak status`

One answer for "what is running?": the Host (pid, version, uptime, idle grace), every Terminal
and every client with its **client id** (`subak detach --client` takes it). Without a Host it
says so and exits 0 (`running: false`). It starts nothing. The list includes the `status`
command's own connection (kind `cli`, not attached). `--json`: `{running, endpoint, host,
terminals, clients}`.

### 3.4 `subak info <target>`

One Terminal: state, window, pane, the command (or `… (verbatim)` for a verbatim line), the
resolved executable, pid, process count, size, clients, working directory, the names of its
environment overrides and how it last ended. Exit 3 (`target_not_found`) when no Terminal matches,
so `subak info work >NUL 2>&1 && …` tests for existence (tmux `has-session`).
`--json`: `{terminal}` (the IPC Terminal object).

### 3.5 `subak attach [<target>]`

```text
subak attach [<target>] [--size <cols>x<rows>] [--read-only] [--dry-run [--json]]
```

Connects this terminal to the Terminal's pane: you see its screen as it is — also a full-screen
program — with the earlier lines in this window's scrollback (once; [SCROLLBACK §2](SCROLLBACK.md)),
then live output, and your keys go to its program. Without a target it attaches to the Host's only running
Terminal (`ambiguous_target` with the candidates when there are several; `subak host attach` is
the same). The pane takes this window's size and follows it. `--read-only` watches without
sending keys or resizing. Keys, signals and what happens to your console are in [§5](#5-attach-and-detach).
It exits 0 when detached or when the program ended, with a notice on stderr:

```text
[subak: attached to `build` (t-3633c7e09d6d) in Host pid 62452, pid 61928; Ctrl+B d detaches]
...
[subak: detached; the shell keeps running in Host pid 62452 (Terminal `build`)]
```

### 3.6 `subak detach [<target>] [--client <id>]`

Detaches clients **from outside**: from another terminal, a script or an agent.

| Form | Detaches |
| --- | --- |
| `subak detach <target>` | every client attached to that Terminal (tmux `detach-client -s`) |
| `subak detach --client <id>` | that one client, wherever it is attached (`subak status` lists ids) |
| `subak detach <target> --client <id>` | that client's attachment to that Terminal only |
| `subak detach` inside a pane | every client of the pane's own Terminal (`SUBAK_TERMINAL_ID`) |

Nothing else changes: no process, no Terminal, no connection is ended, and nothing asks for
consent. Each detached `subak attach` exits 0 with `[subak: detached from `<name>` by another
client (pid …, cli); it keeps running in Host pid …]` and puts its console back. With nobody
attached the answer is an empty list (exit 0); an unknown client id is `target_not_found`.
`--dry-run` lists what would be detached. `--json`: `{detached: [{client, stream_id, pane_id,
terminal_id, interactive}], terminal, host}`.

### 3.7 `subak rename <target> <new-name>`

Renames a Terminal; its id, processes and attachments stay. Changing only the case of its own name
is allowed; another Terminal's name is `name_conflict`. `--dry-run` checks without renaming.

### 3.8 `subak stop | kill | rm <target>`

| Command | Processes | Terminal | Consent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stop` | closed gracefully (`CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT`), whatever is left after 5 s ended | kept as `stopped` | ask or `--yes` while it runs |
| `kill` | ended at once | removed | ask or `--yes`, always |
| `rm` | refused while it runs (`invalid_state`); `--force` = `kill` | removed | ask or `--yes` |

The CLI confirms with the user, then acts on the Terminal **by id**, so a rename in between
cannot redirect it. `--dry-run` shows `busy`, the processes and whether it ends processes or
removes the Terminal ([SESSION_MODEL §4](SESSION_MODEL.md)).

### 3.9 `subak capture | history | clear-history [<target>]`

```text
subak capture [<target>] [--start <line>|-] [--end <line>|-] [--history] [--vt] [--join]
              [--no-redact] [--json]
subak history [<target>] [--json]
subak clear-history [<target>] [--yes] [--dry-run] [--json]
```

The Host keeps every pane's screen and the rows that scrolled off it (its history), in memory
only ([SCROLLBACK.md](SCROLLBACK.md)). Without a target, inside a pane these commands use that
pane (`SUBAK_PANE_ID`), else the Host's only Terminal. A `stopped` Terminal can still be read.

- **`capture`** (tmux `capture-pane -p`) prints the screen rows (`--json`: `lines` plus the
  pane's `screen` and `history` counters). Lines are numbered like tmux: screen rows from 0,
  history lines from -1 (the newest) down; `--start`/`--end` take a number or `-` (the oldest
  history line / the last screen row); `--history` is `--start -`. `--vt` keeps colours as escape
  sequences (`-e`), `--join` joins wrapped rows (`-J`). **Secret-looking values are shown as
  `***`** (tokens, passwords, keys; [SCROLLBACK §6](SCROLLBACK.md)) and stderr says how many;
  `--no-redact` shows the exact text. A long range is fetched in several requests.
- **`history`** reports the counters only: rows and bytes kept, the limits, rows evicted and
  cleared, and the screen size, alternate screen and cursor. It never prints content.
- **`clear-history`** (tmux `clear-history`) deletes the Host's copy of the history; the screen,
  the processes and what other terminals already show stay. It deletes data, so it asks, or needs
  `--yes` when it cannot ask (`confirmation_required`, exit 7); `--dry-run` shows how much.

```console
> subak capture build --history | findstr /C:"error"
> subak history build
Terminal `build` (t-3633c7e09d6d) — running: 1834 line(s) of history (152.3 KiB) kept in the Host's memory, limit 2000 lines / 4.0 MiB; 0 evicted, 0 cleared, 1834 in total; never written to disk
screen 120x30, cursor at row 29 column 15
> subak clear-history build --yes
cleared 1834 line(s) (152.3 KiB) of history of Terminal `build`; its screen and processes are unchanged
```

### 3.10 `subak capabilities`

The capabilities document ([CLI_CONTRACT §9](CLI_CONTRACT.md)): every command with usage,
effect, `dry_run` and `requires_yes`. Cheap, starts nothing.

### 3.11 The Host (`subak host …`)

`host start` (explicit start; `new` does this on demand), `host status` (pid, protocol, job,
environment, Terminals, clients with ids), `host health` (identity-checked heartbeat; exit 0 only
when healthy), `host attach` (= `subak attach` without a target), `host stop` (refused with live
Terminals unless `--kill-terminals`, then asks or `--yes`), `host serve` (run the Host in this
process). Details: [IPC_PROTOCOL §8](contracts/IPC_PROTOCOL.md), [CONPTY_PROOF](CONPTY_PROOF.md).
Every client verifies that the pipe is served by `subak.exe` of this user before it sends a byte;
a Host that does not answer is reported, never ended or replaced.

### 3.12 Keyboard shortcuts (`subak hotkeys …`)

The window's shortcuts follow the Kim hotkey contract ([HOTKEY_CONTRACT §10, §13.1](HOTKEY_CONTRACT.md),
ADR 0017, ADR 0009): the same commands, output (schema
[hotkeys-cli-v1](contracts/schemas/hotkeys-cli-v1.schema.json)) and error codes as `kim hotkeys`
and `noeul hotkeys`. They are **portable and headless**: they read and write one file, never
contact or start a Host, never open a window, never register a hotkey or install a hook.

| Command | Effect | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `subak hotkeys list [--scope <scope>] [--profile <name>]` | read | Every action with its keys, scope, source and state, plus the reserved navigation keys |
| `subak hotkeys show <action> [--profile <name>]` | read | One action and every conflict that involves it |
| `subak hotkeys set <action> <keys>... [--scope global\|app] [--trigger press\|release\|hold] [--hold-ms <ms>] [--repeat] [--profile <name>] [--replace] [--allow-conflict]` | write (`--dry-run`) | Replace an action's bindings; aliases (`ctrl+t`, `C-t`) are stored canonically |
| `subak hotkeys disable <action>\|--all\|--scope <global\|app\|context> [--profile <name>]` | write (`--dry-run`) | Disable one action, every shortcut, or one scope |
| `subak hotkeys enable --all\|--scope <family>` | write (`--dry-run`) | Turn them back on (per action: `reset`) |
| `subak hotkeys reset <action>\|--all [--yes] [--profile <name>]` | write; `--all` destructive (asks or `--yes`) | Restore the default; `--all` discards every change and keeps `hotkeys.json.bak` |
| `subak hotkeys check [--all-tools] [--min-severity error\|warning\|info] [--profile <name>]` | read | The conflict report (exit 0 even with conflicts; read `summary`) |
| `subak hotkeys export` / `import <file> [--dry-run]` | read / write | Print or replace the user layer as a `kim.hotkeys` document (import keeps a backup) |

**The actions** of this build: `terminal.new` `Ctrl+T`, `terminal.close` `Ctrl+W` (destructive:
"Close Terminal" kills it and confirms when busy, ADR 0020), `tab.next` `Ctrl+Tab`,
`tab.previous` `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`, `terminal.rename` `Ctrl+Shift+R`, `tab.hide`, `tab.move-left`,
`tab.move-right` (no default; bind them if you want keys) — all `app` scope — and, in the
`terminal` context, the Step 16 keys `clipboard.copy`, `clipboard.paste`, `view.zoom-in|out|reset`
and `scroll.page-up|page-down|line-up|line-down|top|bottom`. The prefix leader (`Ctrl+B`) and its
table (`window.*`, `pane.*`, `client.detach`, `help.show`) arrive with Step 23 and are not listed
until they work; Subak has no global action yet (`gui.show` is not shipped; Step 18's floating UI is reached without one), so every
`registration` is `not_applicable`.

**The file** is `%APPDATA%\mouv\subak\hotkeys.json` (next to the window's `gui.json`). It holds
only your changes: an action you never changed follows the current default. Writes are atomic.
An open Subak window re-reads the file when it regains focus.

**Safe mode.** A file that is not valid, or was written by a newer Subak, is never rewritten
implicitly: the window uses the defaults, `list` says why (`config.state`: `invalid` or
`newer_version`, and a warning), and every change is refused (`hotkeys_invalid`, exit 4;
`hotkeys_from_newer_version`, exit 5) until you fix it or run `subak hotkeys reset --all --yes`,
which keeps the broken file as `hotkeys.json.bak` (a newer file is never replaced).
`KIM_NO_HOTKEYS=1` (or `subak-gui --no-hotkeys`) starts the window with every shortcut off
without touching the file.

**Conflicts.** A change that collides with another binding of Subak is refused (`hotkey_conflict`,
exit 7) and nothing is written; `--replace` takes the keys away from the other action and lists
both changes. A binding of yours that equals a *default* of another action wins over it
(`default_suppressed`, an info). Reserved chords (`Win+…`, `Alt+F4`, `F6`, typing keys in app
scope, IME keys) are refused with `hotkey_reserved`. `check --all-tools` adds every other
installed Kim tool by reading its installed `hotkeys.manifest.json` and its `hotkeys.json`
(files only; nothing is started).

**Keys for programs.** `Ctrl+T` and `Ctrl+W` are shortcuts of the window, so programs in a pane
do not receive them (`check` reports them as `shadows_terminal_input` infos). Until the prefix
pass-through of Step 23 (`Ctrl+B` followed by the shadowed key), disable or rebind them to give
them back to the program — for example `subak hotkeys disable terminal.close` for readline's
delete-word, or `subak hotkeys set terminal.close Ctrl+Shift+W`.

```console
> subak hotkeys set tab.next ctrl+pagedown
tab.next: Ctrl+Tab (default) → Ctrl+PageDown (user)
Saved to C:\Users\me\AppData\Roaming\mouv\subak\hotkeys.json. An open Subak window applies it when it regains focus.
> subak hotkeys set terminal.rename Ctrl+PageDown
subak: error: Ctrl+PageDown conflicts with another binding
  - duplicate_binding: Ctrl+PageDown is also bound to subak's "Next Terminal tab"; subak's "Rename Terminal" does not fire on Ctrl+PageDown.
hint: try Ctrl+Shift+PageDown or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+PageDown; --replace takes Ctrl+PageDown away from tab.next
```

### 3.13 Settings and shell profiles (`subak config …`, `subak profile …`)

The window's settings and the basic shell profiles live in `%APPDATA%\mouv\subak\config.toml`
([SUBAK_GUI §13](SUBAK_GUI.md), [ADR 0051](adr/0051-subak-settings-profiles-and-appearance.md),
[STATE_SCHEMA §2](contracts/STATE_SCHEMA.md)). These commands are **portable and headless**: they
read and write that file (and its `backups\`) only, never contact or start a Host, never open a
window, and never change a running Terminal. The window's Settings menu changes the same lines
(`KIM-FR-013`); a running window applies them when it next gets the focus.

| Command | Effect | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `subak config show` | read | Every setting with its value, default and source (`file` or `default`), the profiles (secret-looking values as `***`), problems and unknown keys, the backup folder |
| `subak config check` | read | The file's state and every problem with its key, line and severity; exit 0 (`valid` says whether every value was used) |
| `subak config set <key> <value>` (or `<key>=<value>`) | write (`--dry-run`) | Change one setting by editing its line in place; comments and unknown keys stay; an invalid value is refused (`usage`) and nothing is written |
| `subak config reset <key>\|<section>\|--all [--yes]` | write; `--all` destructive (asks or `--yes`) | Remove the keys so their defaults apply; profiles and unknown keys stay; `--all` keeps a backup and also replaces an invalid file |
| `subak config export` | read | The file (or, without one, a header with the defaults) with every secret-looking value replaced by `***` |
| `subak config import <file> [--dry-run]` | write | Replace the file with a checked one (valid, this version or older, no secrets); the current file is backed up first |
| `subak profile list` | read | The profiles and which one is the default |
| `subak profile show <name>` | read | One profile (names ignore case) |

**Keys**: `appearance.theme` (`auto`, `system`, `kim-dark`, `kim-light`, `high-contrast`),
`appearance.font_family`, `appearance.font_size` (8–36), `appearance.line_height` (1.0–2.0),
`appearance.padding` (0–16), `appearance.opacity` (50–100), `appearance.motion` (`system`,
`reduced`, `full`), `appearance.bold_is_bright`, `terminal.default_profile`,
`terminal.copy_on_select`, `terminal.smart_ctrl_c`, `terminal.alt_is_meta` and
`terminal.backspace` (`del`, `ctrl-h`, `delete`; #98 T2), `terminal.bell` (`off`, `visual`,
`audible`; #98 T3), `terminal.notify_command_seconds` (0–86400, 0: off) and `terminal.notify_exit`
(#98 T3), `dropdown.height` (20–100) and `dropdown.hide_on_blur` (#98 T3, `subak-gui --dropdown`),
`terminal.focus_follows_mouse`, `tabs.close_buttons`, `tabs.cycle`, `tabs.title`, `tabs.on_exit`
(`keep`, `close`) and `appearance.density` (`regular`, `compact`) (#98 T1), `terminal.claude_indicators` (Step 28),
`terminal.claude_animation` (Step 44),
`terminal.right_click` (`copy-paste`,
`menu`, `paste`, `none`), `terminal.middle_click` (`none`, `paste`), `terminal.word_separators`.
Booleans take `true`/`false` (or `on`/`off`). A value that starts with `-` is given as
`<key>=<value>`. Profiles are `[[profiles]]` tables of the file (`name`, `program`, `args`, `cwd`,
`env`, `unset_env`); edit them by hand or `import` a file.

**Safety.** An invalid or newer file is never rewritten by `set` or `reset <key>`
(`config_invalid`, exit 4; `config_from_newer_version`, exit 5); `reset --all --yes` replaces an
invalid file after copying it to `backups\config-invalid-<UTC>.toml`, and a newer file is never
replaced. `reset --all` and `import` copy the current file to `backups\config-<UTC>.toml` first
(the newest 5 are kept). `import` refuses a document with problems (`config_invalid`, with every
problem and its line) and one that holds a secret-looking value (`secret_in_config`, exit 4:
a variable named like a token or password, a token-shaped value or URL password, a `--password`
argument, or a `***` from an export). Secret-looking values typed into the file by hand are
warned about by name and never printed.

**`subak new --profile <name>`** starts a profile: its program and arguments (unless `-- <program>`
or `--command-line` is given), its folder (unless `--cwd`), and its environment overrides (an
`--env`/`--unset-env` of the same variable wins). Without a program, `subak new` uses
`terminal.default_profile` unless `--no-profile`. The Host receives the explicit command, folder
and environment; it never reads profiles. `--json` adds `profile` (its name) when a profile was used, to the
result and to dry runs. `profile_not_found` (exit 3) names the profiles there are; an invalid
settings file is `config_invalid`. A default profile that is missing, or a settings file that is invalid or newer, only warns when no `--profile` is given (the Host's
shell runs).

```console
> subak config set appearance.theme kim-light
subak: warning: a running Subak window applies the change when it next gets the focus; running Terminals are not changed

`error-profile-not-found.json`, `error-secret-in-config.json`).

### 3.14 Windows and panes (`subak window …`, `subak pane …`)

Step 21 ([ADR 0054](adr/0054-subak-internal-windows-and-panes.md),
[SESSION_MODEL §1–§5](SESSION_MODEL.md)). A Terminal (a GUI tab) holds **internal windows**, each
with **panes**; every pane runs its own process. Windows are numbered from 0 (a new one takes the
lowest free index), panes from 0 within their window (renumbered when one goes). The active window
and each window's active pane are the Host's, the same for every client. Since Step 22 the panes
of a window share it by a layout (§3.15).

| Command | Effect | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `subak window new <terminal> [--name <name>] [--no-select] [--cwd …] [--env …] [--unset-env …] [--size …] [--history-limit …] [-- <program> [args…] \| --command-line <line>] [--dry-run]` | write | A new window with one pane running `<program>` (default `%ComSpec%`), in a running Terminal; named after the program unless `--name`; it becomes the active window unless `--no-select` (tmux `new-window [-d] [-n]`). Never starts a Host |
| `subak pane new <terminal\|window> [same options, no --name]` | write | A new pane in a window (a Terminal target: its active window): a vertical split of its active pane (§3.15) |
| `subak window ls <terminal>`, `subak pane ls <terminal\|window>` | read | The windows (index, name, id, panes, active pane), or every pane (`window.pane`, id, pid, state, program); `*` marks the active ones |
| `subak window select <window> [--dry-run]`, `subak pane select <pane> [--dry-run]` | write | The active window, or a window's active pane (and that window), for every client; no process changes |
| `subak window rename <window> <name> [--dry-run]` | write | A window's name; need not be unique, not only digits |
| `subak window kill <window>`, `subak pane kill <pane>` `[--dry-run] [--yes]` | destructive | End that window's panes, or that pane, at once and remove it; every other pane keeps running. Asks (or needs `--yes`) and ends exactly the confirmed id. The last running window or pane of a Terminal is refused (`invalid_state`): `subak kill` ends a Terminal |

```text
> subak window new work --name build -- cargo.exe watch
created window 1:build.0 (w-5d2e8a1c0b93 p-6e1f0a2b3c4d, pid 7124); it is now the active one
> subak pane ls work
Terminal `work` (t-3fa9c0d21b7e), running
PANE      ID                  PID  STATE     PROGRAM
0.0*      p-9b0e7d6c5a41     5680  running   C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe
1.0*      p-6e1f0a2b3c4d     7124  running   cargo.exe
> subak window kill work:build --yes
pid 7124 ended (exit code 1, forced); window w-5d2e8a1c0b93 removed; every other pane keeps running
```

Errors: a target of the wrong level (`window kill work`, `pane kill work:1`) is `usage` (exit 2);
another Terminal's window or pane under `work:` is `target_not_found` (exit 3); a window or pane
change in a Terminal that is not running is `invalid_state` (exit 7), as is the last running
window or pane (`details.reason`); a busy pane without consent is `confirmation_required` (exit 7).
A pane whose program exits leaves its window while others run; the exit of the last running pane
ends the Terminal as before.

### 3.15 Splits and the layout (`subak pane split|resize|swap|zoom`)

Step 22 ([ADR 0056](adr/0056-subak-pane-splits-and-layout.md)). A window's panes share its area
by a **layout** the Host keeps (tmux terms: `--horizontal` side by side, `--vertical` stacked).
The window's size is the latest interactive client's; every pane's program sees exactly its share.

| Command | Effect | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `subak pane split <pane\|window\|terminal> [--horizontal\|--vertical] [--before] [--cells N\|--percent N] [--no-select] [--cwd …] [--env …] [--unset-env …] [--history-limit …] [-- <program> [args…] \| --command-line <line>] [--dry-run]` | write | Split the pane (a window or Terminal target: its active pane) and start a new pane next to it, at half of it by default (tmux `split-window`). A pane too small (each needs 2×2 cells) is `invalid_state` with `need`/`have` |
| `subak pane resize <pane> <left\|right\|up\|down> [cells] [--dry-run]` | write | Move the pane's border that way (default 1 cell; tmux `resize-pane -L/-R/-U/-D`): into the neighbour on that side, else the opposite border moves. `moved` says how far |
| `subak pane swap <pane> <other\|next\|previous> [--dry-run]` | write | Swap two panes of one window (tmux `swap-pane`); processes stay with their panes |
| `subak pane zoom <pane> [on\|off] [--dry-run]` | write | The pane fills the window; the others keep running, unseen (tmux `resize-pane -Z`, a toggle by default). Selecting another pane unzooms |
| `subak pane select <pane> [left\|right\|up\|down\|next\|previous]` | write | Also the pane next to it (by geometry or index; wraps) |
| `subak window rotate <window\|terminal> [up\|down] [--dry-run]` | write | Every pane moves one place along the pane order (tmux `rotate-window`) |
| `subak window layout <window\|terminal> <even-horizontal\|even-vertical\|tiled> [--dry-run]` | write | Arrange the panes evenly (tmux `select-layout`; the other presets with Step 25) |

tmux spellings: `split-window`, `resize-pane`, `swap-pane`, `rotate-window`, `select-layout`. `pane ls` shows each pane's size and
place (`40x24@41,0`, `(hidden)` while another is zoomed).

```text
> subak pane split work --horizontal
split: created pane 0:cmd.1 (w-db5581297310 p-6d709b67a392, pid 114752); it is now the active one
> subak pane resize work:0.0 right 10
moved the border by 10 cell(s) in window w-db5581297310 (81x24); every process keeps running
  pane 0  p-0edbf0899ea1  50x24@0,0
  pane 1* p-6d709b67a392  30x24@51,0
```

### 3.16 tmux command lines and paste buffers (`subak command`, `subak buffer`)

Step 24 ([ADR 0058](adr/0058-subak-tmux-commands-copy-mode-and-buffers.md)).

**`subak command '<line>'`** (also `subak tmux`, or the words after `--`) runs tmux commands:
`new-session`, `kill-session`, `rename-session`, `list-sessions`, `new-window`, `kill-window`,
`rename-window`, `select-window`, `next-window`, `previous-window`, `list-windows`,
`split-window`, `kill-pane`, `select-pane`, `list-panes`, `resize-pane`, `swap-pane`,
`rotate-window`, `select-layout`, `break-pane`, `join-pane` (`move-pane`), `send-keys`,
`capture-pane`, `set-buffer`, `show-buffer`, `list-buffers`, `delete-buffer`, `paste-buffer`, with
their short aliases (`splitw`, `selectp`, `lsp`, …). Quoting is tmux's (`'…'`, `"…"`, `\`); `;`
separates commands; a line stops at the first refusal. Targets are Subak's (`work`, `work:1`,
`work:1.0`, ids); tmux's relative forms (`{last}`, `:+`, `%3`) are refused with a hint. Without
`-t` a command acts on `--target`, else on the pane `subak command` runs in (`SUBAK_PANE_ID`, set
in every pane). `kill-*` need `--yes`; `--dry-run` parses and plans only; `copy-mode` and
`detach-client` belong to the window. `--json` answers each command's method and result.

```text
> subak command --target work 'split-window -h -l 30%; select-pane -L; list-panes'
> subak command -- send-keys -t work:0.1 'cargo test' Enter
> subak command --target work:1.0 'break-pane -n logs'; subak command 'join-pane -h -s work:1.0 -t work:0.0'
```

Errors are `usage` (exit 2) with `details` `kind: unknown_command | unknown_flag |
unsupported_flag | conflicting_flags | bad_value | bad_target | missing_value | missing_argument |
extra_argument | no_target | syntax`, `confirmation_required` (exit 7) for kills without `--yes`,
and the Host's errors (`target_not_found`, `invalid_state`, …) for the command that failed.

**`subak buffer ls|show [name]|set <text> [--name n] [--append]|delete [name]|paste <pane> [--name
n] [--delete]`**: tmux's paste buffers, kept by the Host **in memory only** (never written or
logged; gone with the Host), newest first, at most 50 (the oldest automatic one goes; named ones
stay), 1 MiB each. `ls` shows names, sizes and a redacted first line; `show` the text. `paste`
types it into the pane with line ends as carriage returns. `set`, `delete` and `paste` take
`--dry-run`.

### 3.27 Host costs (Step 39)

`subak host stats [--endpoint <name>]`: the running Host's working set and private memory,
handle count, CPU time (kernel and user), Terminals, panes, clients, scrollback, sessions and IPC
counters (IPC `host.stats`); starts nothing (`host_not_running` without a Host).
[PERFORMANCE](PERFORMANCE.md) lists what they cost and the budgets `cargo xtask bench` checks.

### 3.26 Kim interop provider (Step 38)

[ADR 0071](adr/0071-capability-interop.md), [INTEROP](INTEROP.md). `subak interop invoke --json
--no-input [--endpoint <name>]` reads one `kim.interop.request` from stdin and serves
`terminal.list` (read; no Host started), `terminal.open` (a shell or a profile, never a program
of the caller's choice) and `terminal.paste-path` (an existing file's quoted path typed into a
pane, no Enter). Other tools call it through `kim tools invoke`. `SUBAK_ENDPOINT` sets the default
endpoint for a process tree (`--endpoint` wins).

### 3.25 MCP server (Step 37)

[ADR 0070](adr/0070-mcp-server.md), [MCP_GUIDE](MCP_GUIDE.md).

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `subak mcp serve [--allow create\|input\|run\|control\|destructive\|recover]… [--endpoint <name>]` | an MCP server on stdin/stdout for the agent that starts it; read-only without `--allow`; stdout carries only MCP messages; `--dry-run` prints the tools it would offer and exits |
| `subak mcp tools [--allow …]` | the tools such a server offers, with their schemas and annotations (no Host) |

### 3.24 Telnet, serial ports and ssh config hosts (Step 36)

[ADR 0069](adr/0069-telnet-serial-and-the-parity-review.md). Telnet and serial Terminals are panes
whose program is Subak's own bridge; they detach and survive closing the window like any other.

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `subak telnet connect <host[:port]> [<name>] --allow-insecure` | a Telnet pane (default port 23); refused without `--allow-insecure` (`invalid_state`, exit 7) and always warned about: it is unencrypted |
| `subak serial list` | the COM ports Windows lists (read only) |
| `subak serial connect COMn [<name>] [--baud 9600] [--data-bits 8] [--parity none\|odd\|even\|mark\|space] [--stop-bits 1\|1.5\|2] [--flow none\|rtscts\|xonxoff] [--newline cr\|lf\|crlf] [--local-echo]` | a serial pane; a missing or busy port is reported in the pane |
| `subak ssh hosts [--ssh-config <file>]` | the `Host` entries of `~/.ssh/config` (HostName, User, Port, IdentityFile, ProxyJump); `ssh connect <alias>` connects to one |

A profile may have `group = "…"` (`profile list` shows it). What Tabby has and Subak does not yet:
[TABBY_PARITY_REPORT](TABBY_PARITY_REPORT.md) and follow-up #98.

### 3.23 SFTP, jump hosts, forwarding, proxies and login scripts (Step 35)

[ADR 0068](adr/0068-sftp-forwarding-and-jump-hosts.md). Every `sftp` command takes the connection
options `--identity`, `--option`, `--ssh-config <file>` (`ssh -F`), `--jump <host>` (repeatable)
and `--proxy`. It never prompts and never trusts a new host: connect once with `ssh connect` first.

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `subak sftp ls <dest> [<path>]` | the directory (`entries`: name, type, size, mode, mtime) |
| `subak sftp get <dest> <remote> [<local>] [--recursive] [--overwrite\|--resume] [--background]` | download; `*.subak-part` until complete; `file_exists` (exit 7) unless `--overwrite`; `unsafe_path` (exit 4) for a remote name that could escape the folder |
| `subak sftp put <dest> <local> [<remote>] [--recursive] [--overwrite\|--resume] [--private] [--background]` | upload (`0644`/`0755`, `--private` `0600`/`0700`) |
| `subak sftp mkdir <dest> <path> [--private] [--dry-run]` / `sftp rm <dest> <path> --yes` | create a directory / delete a file or empty directory |
| `subak transfer list` / `transfer status <id>` / `transfer cancel <id>` | background transfers: `queued`, `running`, `done`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `interrupted`, with bytes and files done |

`ssh connect` (and SSH profiles: `jump = [...]`, `forwards = [...]`, `agent_forward`,
`login_script`) adds:

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--jump [user@]host[:port]` (repeat) | ProxyJump through each hop in order; a saved password answers only the prompt of the host it was saved for |
| `--forward L:[bind:]port:host:port`, `R:…`, `D:[bind:]port` (repeat) | local, remote and SOCKS forwards on loopback; a taken port is `port_in_use`; beyond loopback only with `--allow-public-bind` (warned) |
| `--no-shell` | forwards only (`ssh -N`); kill the Terminal to end them |
| `--agent-forward`, `--x11` | off by default; a warning in `data.ssh.warnings` and on stderr; X11 needs `DISPLAY` and your X server |
| `--proxy socks5://host:port` \| `http://host:port` | through a SOCKS5 or HTTP CONNECT proxy (no proxy credentials; not with `--jump`) |
| `--login-script <file.toml>` | `[[step]] expect = "…" send = "…"` (`enter`, `timeout` optional) typed after the expected text; `data.login_script` lists each step; secret-looking text is refused |

Not available yet: Zmodem, the window's SFTP panel and drag and drop, editing remote files
locally, adding forwards to a live session, connection reuse, WinSCP (Step 36; see the Tabby
matrix).

### 3.22 SSH sessions and saved secrets (Step 34)

[ADR 0067](adr/0067-ssh-through-windows-openssh-and-credential-manager.md): an SSH pane runs
Windows' OpenSSH client, so it is a Terminal like any other.

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `subak ssh connect <[user@]host[:port]> [<name>] [--identity <key>] [--option Key=Value]… [--attach] [--dry-run]` | a Terminal running `ssh` with `StrictHostKeyChecking=ask` and `ForwardAgent=no`; `data.ssh` says whether the host is in known_hosts and whether a saved secret is used |
| `subak ssh credential status <dest> [--option UserKnownHostsFile=<f>]` | saved or not, verified or not (never the secret) |
| `subak ssh credential save <dest> [--dry-run]` | asks for the password or passphrase without echo (or reads one stdin line) and keeps it in Windows Credential Manager; refused for a host not in known_hosts |
| `subak ssh credential forget <dest> [--dry-run]` | removes it |

An SSH profile in `config.toml` has `ssh = "user@host:port"` and optionally `identity = '<key>'`
instead of `program`/`args`; `subak new --profile <name>` and the window menu start it. A new host
shows ssh's fingerprint question in the pane: answer it yourself. A changed key is refused. When ssh
ends, the pane keeps its last screen.

### 3.21 Detected shells and the shell integration (Step 33)

[ADR 0066](adr/0066-detected-shell-profiles-and-shell-integration.md).

- `subak profile list|show` include the shells found on this PC (`source: detected`): PowerShell 7,
  Windows PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash and one `WSL: <distro>` per distribution;
  `subak new --profile "Git Bash"` starts one. A `[[profiles]]` entry of the same name wins;
  `subak config set terminal.detect_shells false` hides them. A profile's `title` names the new
  Terminal when no name is given and the name is free.

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `subak shell-integration status [powershell\|pwsh\|cmd] [--profile-file <ps1>]` | whether Subak's block is in your PowerShell profile; for cmd, the per-profile `PROMPT` opt-in |
| `subak shell-integration install [powershell\|pwsh] [--profile-file <ps1>] [--dry-run]` | adds a marked block to `$PROFILE` (backup first), active only in Subak panes: the shell reports its folder, shown as the pane's `current_dir` and kept by `state.json` |
| `subak shell-integration uninstall …` | removes exactly that block |

PowerShell runs a profile only where its execution policy allows scripts; Subak never changes the
policy.

### 3.20 Cold recovery (`subak recover`, Step 30)

[ADR 0064](adr/0064-cold-recovery-and-claude-resume.md), [RECOVERY.md §4](RECOVERY.md).

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `subak recover list` | the saved Terminals and, pane by pane, what a restore would start and what it cannot bring back; starts nothing |
| `subak recover <terminal> [--dry-run] [--claude-resume] [--with-commands] --yes` | the Terminal again: its id, name, windows and layout, a fresh shell per pane; `--claude-resume` resumes the saved Claude session, `--with-commands` runs saved start commands |

Without `--yes` (and not a dry run): `confirmation_required` (exit 7). A Terminal already
running is `invalid_state` (exit 7), never started twice.

### 3.19 Durable state (`subak state`, Step 29)

[ADR 0063](adr/0063-durable-terminal-state.md), [RECOVERY.md](RECOVERY.md). The Host writes
`state.json` (default endpoint: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\mouv\subak\state\`; else `host start
--state-dir <dir>`); loading it starts nothing.

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `subak state show [--state-dir <dir>]` | the saved Terminals (and what a restore would not find); read only |
| `subak state check` | the same; exit 4 `state_corrupt` or 5 `state_from_newer_version` |
| `subak state backups` | the backups, newest first (at most 5) |
| `subak state policy <terminal> ask\|auto\|never [--dry-run]` | whether it is restored when Subak next opens (Step 30) |
| `subak state forget <saved terminal> [--dry-run]` | removes a saved record |
| `subak state rollback [<backup>] [--dry-run]` | makes a backup current; refused while a Host runs |

`policy` and `forget` go through the running Host; without one they edit the file after a
backup.

### 3.18 Claude Code hooks and sessions (`subak claude`, Step 27)

[ADR 0061](adr/0061-claude-code-hooks-and-session-events.md), [CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md](CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md).

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `subak claude hooks status [--settings <file>]` | whether Subak's hooks are in a Claude Code settings file (default `~/.claude/settings.json`) |
| `subak claude hooks install [--settings <file>] [--dry-run]` | opt in: merge Subak's hooks, keeping every other setting and hook; a backup first |
| `subak claude hooks uninstall [--settings <file>] [--dry-run]` | remove exactly Subak's entries; a backup first |
| `subak claude report` | run by the hooks: forward the event and session id to the pane's Host; prints nothing (with `--json`, whether it was delivered), always exit 0 |
| `subak claude status [<target>]` (also `subak claude list`) | the Claude sessions per pane and their states (read-only); `subak ls`/`info` give each Terminal's aggregate `claude_state` (Step 28, ADR 0062) |

An invalid settings file is `config_invalid` (exit 2) and is not changed.

### 3.17 Advanced tmux commands (Step 25)

[ADR 0059](adr/0059-subak-advanced-tmux-behaviours.md). `subak command` also runs:

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `select-layout main-horizontal\|main-vertical[-mirrored]`, `-E`, `-n`, `-p`; `next-layout`, `previous-layout` | tmux's presets (main pane 24 rows / 80 columns), spread, cycle; also `subak window layout <w> <preset\|next\|previous\|spread>` |
| `setw [-t w] synchronize-panes\|monitor-activity\|monitor-bell [on\|off]` (`set -w`, `set-option`) | a window option; no value toggles; `-g` is refused |
| `show-options [-t w]` (`showw`) | the window's options |
| `last-window`, `last-pane` | the previous window or pane |
| `display-message -p [-t target] '<format>'` | prints `#{session_name}`, `#S:#I.#P`, `#{?pane_synchronized,on,off}`, … (method `format`) |
| `set-hook [-u] <hook> '<tmux commands>'`, `show-hooks` | hooks the Host runs after its events (no `kill-*`) |
| `list-commands` (`lscm`) | the commands Subak reads (method `text`) |

Targets take tmux's tokens after a Terminal (`work:{last}`, `work:+1`, `work:.{left-of}`,
`work:1.!`); a bare token is still refused.

```text
> subak command --target work 'select-layout main-vertical; setw synchronize-panes on'
> subak command --target work 'set-hook after-split-window "select-layout tiled"'
> subak command --json --target work 'display -p "#S:#I.#P #{window_flags}"'
```

## 4. Typical sessions

```console
> subak new work                 # starts the Host, creates `work`
> subak attach work              # type; Ctrl+B d detaches; close the window: still running
> subak ls
> subak rename work api
> subak detach api               # from another terminal: every client of `api` lets go
> subak kill api                 # asks; --yes in scripts
```

## 5. Attach and detach

| Key or event | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+B d` | Detach. `Ctrl+B Ctrl+B` sends one `Ctrl+B` to the program; `Ctrl+B` followed by anything else sends both keys. Since Step 23 both keys follow `hotkeys.json`: the `prefix` leader (a `Ctrl+<letter>`) and `client.detach`'s `@prefix char:<c>`; the banner names the keys in use. |
| `Ctrl+C` | A key for the program (`0x03`; ConPTY raises `CTRL_C_EVENT` in the pane): it interrupts what runs there. It never ends the client. |
| `Ctrl+Break` | Detaches this client cleanly. It is not sent to the program (ConPTY has no input encoding for it; ADR 0025 §5). |
| Closing the window, killing the client | A detach as far as the Host is concerned: the Terminal keeps running. |
| `subak detach …` from elsewhere | Detach with a notice naming the other client. |
| The program exits | The client exits 0 with its exit code in the notice. |

**The detach key** is fixed in the CLI for now: `Ctrl+B d` are the defaults of the hotkey
contract's `prefix` leader and `client.detach` action ([HOTKEY_CONTRACT §13.1](HOTKEY_CONTRACT.md)).
Rebinding arrives with Subak's `hotkeys.json` in Steps 17 and 23, for the GUI and the CLI alike;
there is deliberately no CLI-only key option.

**Your console** is switched to raw mode while attached (no line editing or echo by the console,
`Ctrl+C` delivered as a key, VT input and output, UTF-8 output code page) and put back when the
attach ends. The restore runs once, from whichever comes first: the end of the attach (detach,
program end, an error), a crash (panic hook), or the console closing, logoff or shutdown (console
control handler). It first switches off what the program left on in your terminal and did not
switch off itself — alternate screen, hidden cursor, mouse reporting, bracketed paste, focus
events, application cursor keys and keypad — and only then restores the saved modes.

Measured inside an outer pseudo console (the mechanism Windows Terminal uses to host shells;
`tests/subak_cli.rs::console_attach_restores_the_console_on_every_exit_path_it_survives`), with a
probe that reads the console's state:

| Moment | Input mode | Output mode | Code page | Cursor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Before the attach | `0x1F7` (cooked) | `0x7` | 65001 | visible |
| Attached (the pane's prompt hides the cursor) | `0x3E8` (raw, VT input) | `0xF` (VT) | 65001 | hidden |
| After `Ctrl+B d` | `0x1F7` | `0x7` | 65001 | visible |
| After `subak detach` from elsewhere | `0x1F7` | `0x7` | 65001 | visible |
| After `Ctrl+Break` | `0x1F7` | `0x7` | 65001 | visible |
| After the client was **killed** (`TerminateProcess`) | `0x3E8` (still raw) | `0xF` | 65001 | hidden |

A killed client runs no code, so nothing can restore the console then; the shell around it decides.
Measured (`cmd_and_windows_powershell_keep_working_after_an_attach_ends_or_is_killed`):
**cmd.exe** resets the console when the client ends and takes the next command normally (cooked,
`0x3EF`); **Windows PowerShell 5.1** (PSReadLine) also takes the next command normally, but its
console keeps `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT` (`0x3E0` at the prompt, against `0x1E4` after a
clean detach). If a program started there afterwards misreads keys, open a new tab or window.
The output code page of an outer pseudo console is already 65001, so its restore is not visible
there; in a classic console window it returns to the previous value (for example 437 or 949).

**Redirected input or output.** With redirected stdin (a pipe or a file), the bytes are sent to
the program as they are (a UTF-8 byte order mark at the start is dropped) and the **end of input
detaches**; `Ctrl+C` in a console that is still attached is then a signal and detaches cleanly
(the same handler as Ctrl+Break, which is tested; this case is not tested separately).
With redirected stdout, the pane's output bytes are written unchanged, and if the reader goes
away the client detaches. Raw mode and the restore apply only to the parts that are a console. A
`--read-only` attach reads no redirected input at all and runs until it is detached, the program
ends or the Host stops: `subak attach build --read-only > build.log` records a Terminal until
`subak detach build`.

**Where it runs.** Windows Terminal, Windows PowerShell 5.1 and cmd.exe (classic console or any
ConPTY host) are supported; the automated tests run the client inside a pseudo console from
cmd.exe and from PowerShell 5.1. Not tested: Windows Terminal's own window (a GUI; tests must stay
headless — it hosts shells through the same ConPTY), PowerShell 7 (not installed on the test
machine; Subak installs nothing), and the panic path (it cannot be triggered without a test hook).

## 6. Verbatim command lines

Windows passes a program one command line, and most programs split it by the
`CommandLineToArgvW` rules, which is how `-- <program> [args…]` quotes each word. `cmd.exe /c`
reads the text after `/c` itself, with its own rules for quotes, `^`, `&`, `|` and `>`, so a word
containing `"` cannot be expressed that way. `--command-line <line>` passes one line verbatim:

```console
> subak new build --command-line "cmd.exe /d /s /c \"(echo \"a  b\"&echo ^&x)>C:\tmp\out.txt\""
```

- Only the first word is looked up on the pane's `PATH`; batch and PowerShell scripts are still
  refused (`not_executable`), so a script never runs through a shell you did not name.
- The dry run shows the exact line (`would_create.command_line`); `info` shows it with
  secret-looking words as `***` (`--token=***`).
- The line is **one argument** to `subak`, so the calling shell's quoting applies:
  - **cmd.exe** passes it unchanged; write inner quotes as `\"` as above.
  - **Windows PowerShell 5.1** splits a single-quoted line that contains `"` (legacy argument
    passing); `subak` then refuses it with `usage` and nothing starts. Use the stop-parsing token —
    `subak --% new build --command-line "cmd.exe /d /s /c \"echo \"a  b\"\""` — or write `\"`
    inside single quotes. Both were measured.
  - **PowerShell 7.3+** passes `'cmd.exe /d /s /c "echo "a  b""'` correctly (not tested here).
  - **Agents and programs** pass it as one argument of their process API (Rust `Command::arg`,
    Python `subprocess` with a list), which quotes it correctly.

Measured (`verbatim_command_lines_reach_cmd_exe_exactly_as_written`): cmd.exe received
`cmd.exe /d /s /c "(echo "a  b"&echo ^&x&echo two)>"…\out.txt""` unchanged and wrote the three
lines `"a  b"`, `&x` and `two` (exit 0); the same text given as separate words reached cmd with
`\"` and wrote nothing (exit 1).

## 7. Recipes for agents and scripts

Always pass `--json` (and `--no-input`, or set `KIM_NO_INPUT=1`), close stdin, start `subak`
without a console window, and branch on the exit code or `error.code`, never on message text.

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Is anything running? | `subak status --json` → `data.running`, `data.terminals` |
| Does `build` exist? | `subak info build --json` → exit 0, or 3 with `target_not_found` |
| Create, or reuse when it exists | `subak new build --json -- …`; on exit 7 `name_conflict`, `subak info build --json` |
| Create only if a Host already runs | `subak new build --no-start --json -- …` (exit 3 otherwise) |
| Check a program before starting it | `subak new --dry-run --json -- pwsh` → `would_create.executable`, or `spawn_failed` |
| Run cmd.exe text exactly | `subak new job --json --remain-on-exit --command-line "cmd.exe /d /s /c \"…\""` |
| Wait for a program to finish | poll `subak info job --json` until `state` is `stopped` (with `--remain-on-exit`), then read `last_exit.exit_code` |
| Feed input non-interactively | pipe bytes into `subak attach job`; the end of input detaches |
| Record output | `subak attach job --read-only > job.log`, later `subak detach job` |
| Read what a pane shows, or its whole history | `subak capture job --json` → `data.lines`; `subak capture job --history --json` (redacted; `--no-redact` only with the user's consent) |
| Read the output of a finished program | create it with `--remain-on-exit`, wait for `stopped`, then `subak capture job --history --json` |
| Make sure nobody is watching | `subak detach job --json` |
| Stop work, with the user's consent | `subak stop job --yes --json` (only after the user confirmed in your UI; CLI_CONTRACT §9.6) |
| Remove everything and the Host | `subak host stop --kill-terminals --yes --json` (destructive) |

A command that would need consent and cannot ask fails with `confirmation_required` (exit 7) and
says what `--yes` would confirm. Nothing an agent runs this way opens a window or prompts.

## 8. tmux at a glance

| tmux | Subak |
| --- | --- |
| `tmux new -s work [-d]` | `subak new work` (detached by default; `--attach` attaches) |
| `tmux new -A -s work` | `subak info work` then `subak attach work` or `subak new work --attach` |
| `tmux -N` | `subak new --no-start` |
| `tmux ls` | `subak ls` |
| `tmux has -t work` | `subak info work` (exit 0 / 3) |
| `tmux attach -t work [-r]` | `subak attach work [--read-only]` |
| `tmux detach` (`C-b d`) | `Ctrl+B d` |
| `tmux detach -s work` / `-t client` | `subak detach work` / `subak detach --client <id>` |
| `tmux lsc` | `subak status` (clients with ids) |
| `tmux rename -t work api` | `subak rename work api` |
| `tmux kill-session -t work` | `subak kill work` |
| `tmux capture-pane -p [-S -] [-e] [-J] -t work` | `subak capture work [--history] [--vt] [--join]` |
| `tmux clear-history -t work` | `subak clear-history work --yes` |
| `tmux new-window [-d] [-n logs] -t work` | `subak window new work [--no-select] [--name logs]` (also `subak new-window`) |
| `tmux list-windows -t work`, `tmux list-panes -t work[:1]` | `subak window ls work`, `subak pane ls work[:1]` |
| `tmux select-window -t work:1`, `tmux select-pane -t work:1.0` | `subak window select work:1`, `subak pane select work:1.0` |
| `tmux rename-window -t work:1 logs` | `subak window rename work:1 logs` |
| `tmux kill-window -t work:1`, `tmux kill-pane -t work:1.0` | `subak window kill work:1 --yes`, `subak pane kill work:1.0 --yes` (never the last one) |
| `tmux split-window -t work:1` | Step 22; `subak pane new work:1` creates a pane without a split |
| `set -g history-limit 5000` | `subak new work --history-limit 5000` (per Terminal) |
| `tmux start` | `subak host start` (rarely needed) |

## 9. Evidence

Automated on Windows 10 Pro 19045 with real `subak.exe` processes on private endpoints
(`crates/subak/tests/subak_cli.rs`; parser and output unit tests in `crates/subak/src`; the e2e
scenario `e2e/tests/step12_subak_cli.rs`):

| `client_exit_during_attach_leaves_host_work_running` | a killed client and a client whose reader vanished leave `ping` running in the Host; a new client sees it continue |
| `client_detach_over_ipc_ends_only_attachments_and_tells_the_detached_client` | IPC `client.detach` by target and by client id, `pane.detached` before the output stops, connections and the shell untouched, refusals (`invalid_params`, `target_not_found`, MCP `unauthorized`); every message validated against `ipc-v1` |
| `concurrent_commands_share_one_host_and_never_duplicate_a_name` | 6 concurrent `new` → one Host, one Terminal, five `name_conflict`; mixed concurrent creates, lists and status calls; concurrent kills |

| `scrollback_replay.rs` (Step 13) | `capture`, `history`, `clear-history` and `--history-limit` against real panes; reattach coherence, concurrency, resize, eviction, resync, idle cost, redaction ([SCROLLBACK §8](SCROLLBACK.md)) |
| `hotkeys_cli.rs` (Step 17) | every `subak hotkeys` command in a sandboxed profile, validated against `hotkeys-cli-v1`: the shipped defaults, dry runs that write nothing, refused reserved, invalid, unknown and conflicting changes that write nothing, `--replace`, switches, `reset --all` needing `--yes` and keeping a backup, safe mode for a broken and a newer file, export/import keeping unknown fields, `check --all-tools` reading a simulated Noeul install without starting it (also `e2e/tests/step17_subak_hotkeys.rs`) |
| `windows_panes.rs` and `window_and_pane_commands_match_their_golden_files` (Step 21) | the `window` and `pane` commands on real Hosts, validated against `subak-cli-v1` and `ipc-v1`, golden files, levels, cross-Terminal targets, consent, the last window, races ([SESSION_MODEL §7](SESSION_MODEL.md)) |
| `milestone_a.rs` (Step 14) | real `subak attach` clients killed, detached by `Ctrl+B d`, by the end of input and by `subak detach`, reattached to the same programs with their state; 60 cycles without leaks; a reattached client's output equals the Host's history and screen; clients exit 6 when the Host is killed ([MILESTONE_A_VALIDATION](MILESTONE_A_VALIDATION.md)) |

## 10. Not implemented yet

- `pane.send_keys` / `subak send-keys` (Step 24); the CLI writes input only through an attach.
  `attach` does not reconnect by itself.
- Persisted history (Steps 29+, opt-in) and search in history (GUI, Steps 16–25).
- Rebinding the console detach key (`Ctrl+B d` of `subak attach`; Step 23 makes the prefix a
  hotkey-contract leader), `new -A`, `attach -d`, format strings (`-F`,
  Step 25), splits and layouts (Step 22), `last-window`, `next-window`, `previous-window`,
  `kill-window -a` (later Steps). A `subak attach` stays on the pane it attached to when another
  client selects another pane (the GUI follows the selection).
- Persistence and recovery (Steps 29–30): Terminals end with their Host.
- Linux (M4): every command answers `unsupported_platform`.

//! The `subak` package: the Subak terminal CLI and Host (binary `subak`) and, since Step 16, the
//! Subak window (binary `subak-gui`, [`gui`]). Both binaries are thin `main`s over this library;
//! it is not a public API for other packages.
//!
//! Pre-alpha. Besides `capabilities` (docs/CLI_CONTRACT.md §9) the CLI contains the **Host
//! supervisor and IPC v1** (Step 09, ADR 0019, docs/contracts/IPC_PROTOCOL.md), the **Terminal
//! session lifecycle** (Step 10, ADR 0020, docs/SESSION_MODEL.md) and the **Subak CLI** (Step 12,
//! ADR 0027, docs/SUBAK_CLI.md): a detached per-user Host owns any number of named Terminals, each
//! with internal windows and panes (Step 21), each pane in its own pseudo console and job, and the tmux-familiar verbs
//! `subak new|ls|info|status|attach|detach|rename|stop|kill|rm` manage them headlessly. The Host
//! serves an identity-checked named pipe, starts on demand under a start lock, and exits after an
//! idle grace period. Since Step 13 (ADR 0030, docs/SCROLLBACK.md) the Host models each pane's
//! terminal with a bounded scrollback, so an attach reproduces the screen, and
//! `subak capture|history|clear-history` read and clear it. Since Step 16 (ADR 0039,
//! docs/SUBAK_GUI.md) `subak-gui` shows one Terminal in a native window as an IPC client; the
//! Host and the CLI never need it; since Step 17 (ADR 0042) it shows the Host's Terminals as
//! tabs. There are no splits, persistence or recovery yet.
//! Nothing starts by itself, and no `subak` command opens a window.

// Portable modules: compiled and unit-tested on every target, but until the Linux Host (M4,
// ADR 0011) only the Windows Host and clients use most of them.

TERMINALS (Windows only; docs/SUBAK_CLI.md, docs/SESSION_MODEL.md):
    A Terminal is a named workspace in the Host with a stable id (t-...) holding internal
    windows (w-...), each with panes (p-...); a GUI tab is a Terminal, not a window. Each pane
    runs in its own pseudo console and kill-on-close job, so panes never share processes.
    <target> is a Terminal name (exact; case is ignored) or id; where a window or pane is meant,
    <terminal>:<window>[.<pane>] (window: index, name or w- id; pane: index or p- id) or an id.
    new      Create a Terminal running <program> (default: %ComSpec%) in your profile folder or
             --cwd, detached (--attach attaches at once). Without a name it gets the lowest free
             number. Starts a Host if none runs (--no-start fails with `host_not_running`
             instead). A name already in use (ignoring case) is refused with `name_conflict`,
             never suffixed. A program that cannot start leaves nothing behind, unless
             --keep-on-failure keeps it as `failed`.
             <program> and every argument are passed as separate words (quoted for Windows),
             never through a shell. A bare name is looked up on the pane's PATH (cmd,
             powershell, pwsh if you installed it; Subak installs nothing). Batch (.bat/.cmd)
             and PowerShell (.ps1) scripts are refused: name their interpreter
             (-- cmd.exe /d /c script.cmd). --command-line <line> passes one Windows command
             line verbatim instead (only its first word is looked up), for programs that parse
             their own command line, such as cmd.exe /c with inner quotes. The pane gets your
             logon environment (not this terminal's), SUBAK_PANE_ID and SUBAK_TERMINAL_ID, and
             the --env/--unset-env overrides; their values are never shown.
    ls       Every Terminal with its state, pid and clients. Starts nothing.
    status   The Host (or that none runs), every Terminal and every client. Starts nothing;
             exits 0 also without a Host.
    info     One Terminal with its windows and panes; exit 3 (`target_not_found`) if none.
    attach   Connect this terminal to a Terminal's pane (without <target>: the only running
             one). Detaching or closing this window never stops anything (see ATTACH).
    detach   Detach every client of <target>, or the client --client <id> (ids: `subak status`),
             from another terminal or script. Inside a pane, no target means its own Terminal.
             Processes and Terminals are never touched; detached clients exit with a notice.
    rename   Rename a Terminal; its id never changes.
    stop     End its processes: close the pseudo console (programs get CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT), wait
             5 s, then end whatever is left in its job. The Terminal is kept as `stopped`.
             Destructive: asks first, or needs --yes.
    kill     End its processes at once and remove the Terminal. Asks, or needs --yes.
    rm       Remove a Terminal that runs nothing (stopped or failed). --force also ends a
             running one (as kill). Asks, or needs --yes.
    There is no ambiguous `close`: detach looks away, stop ends processes and keeps the record,
    kill and rm remove it. A Terminal whose program exits by itself is removed, unless it was
    created with --remain-on-exit (then `stopped`). Until Step 29 nothing is saved: Terminals
    end with their Host, and stopped ones vanish when the Host exits.

WINDOWS AND PANES (docs/SESSION_MODEL.md §3, ADR 0054; splits and layouts ADR 0056):
    window new   A new internal window of a running Terminal, at the lowest free index, with
             one pane running <program> (default: %ComSpec%); named after the program unless
             --name. It becomes the active window for every client unless --no-select.
    pane new     A new pane with its own process in a window (a Terminal target: its active
             window): a vertical split of the window's active pane (as `pane split`).
    pane split   Split a pane (or a window's or Terminal's active pane) and start a new pane
             next to it: --vertical (stacked, default; tmux -v) or --horizontal (side by side;
             tmux -h), --before (left of or above it), --cells N or --percent N (its size;
             default half). Every pane keeps at least 2x2 cells; a pane too small is refused.
             The panes share the window's size, which is the latest client's.
    pane resize <pane> <left|right|up|down> [cells]   Move the pane's border (tmux
             resize-pane -L/-R/-U/-D; default 1 cell); the panes are resized, nothing ends.
    pane swap <pane> <other|next|previous>   Swap two panes of a window (tmux swap-pane).
    pane zoom <pane> [on|off]   The pane fills the window (others keep running unseen);
             toggles by default (tmux resize-pane -Z). Selecting another pane unzooms.
    pane select <pane> [left|right|up|down|next|previous]   Also the neighbour of a pane.
    window rotate <window> [up|down]   Move every pane one place (tmux rotate-window).
    command '<tmux command>[; …]'   tmux commands (split-window, select-pane, send-keys,
             break-pane, join-pane, set-buffer, list-panes, …; also `subak tmux`, or the words
             after --). No -t: --target, else the pane it runs in. kill-* need --yes.
    buffer ls|show|set|delete|paste   The Host's paste buffers (memory only; ADR 0058).
    window layout <window> <preset|next|previous|spread>   Arrange the panes (tmux select-layout)
             (tmux select-layout; more presets with Step 25).
    window ls, pane ls   The windows, or the panes with pids and programs; * marks the active.
    window select, pane select   The active window or pane, the same for every client (the
             window follows it); no process changes.
    window rename   A window's name (need not be unique; not only digits).
    window kill, pane kill   End that window's or pane's processes at once and remove it; asks,
             or needs --yes; ends exactly the confirmed id; every other pane keeps running. The
             last running window or pane of a Terminal is refused: `kill` ends a Terminal.
    A pane whose program exits leaves its window (the window goes with its last pane); the
    exit of a Terminal's last running pane ends the Terminal as before.

SCROLLBACK (docs/SCROLLBACK.md):
    The Host keeps each pane's screen and the rows that scrolled off its top (its history), in
    its own memory only: up to --history-limit rows (default 2000, 0 keeps none) and 4 MiB per
    pane, the oldest dropped first. Nothing is written to disk or logged. It is gone when the
    Terminal is removed or the Host exits; a stopped Terminal keeps it for `capture`.
    An attach repaints the screen (also a full-screen program on the alternate screen) and puts
    the history into this terminal's scrollback, then streams live output.
    capture  The screen as text, or a range: lines count from 0 on the screen and from -1 (the
             newest history line) down; `-` is the oldest history line (--start) or the last
             screen row (--end); --history = --start -. --vt keeps colours, --join joins
             wrapped rows. Secret-looking values (tokens, passwords, keys) are shown as ***
             unless --no-redact. Inside a pane, no target means that pane.
    history  How many lines and bytes are kept, the limits, evictions, and the screen; never
             the content.
    clear-history  Delete the kept history (the screen stays); asks, or needs --yes. Copies a
             terminal already shows in its own scrollback are not touched.

ATTACH (docs/SUBAK_CLI.md §5):
    Ctrl+B d        Detach (Ctrl+B Ctrl+B sends one Ctrl+B to the program). Since Step 23 it
                    follows your hotkeys.json: the `prefix` leader (a Ctrl+letter) and the
                    character of `client.detach` (`@prefix char:d`); `subak hotkeys set`.
    Ctrl+C          Goes to the program as a key (it interrupts what runs there); it never ends
                    this client.
    Ctrl+Break      Detaches this client cleanly (it is not sent to the program).
    Closing this window, or killing this client, is a detach too: the Terminal keeps running.
    The console's modes and code page are put back on detach, at the program's end, on
    Ctrl+Break, when the window closes and after a crash; modes the program left on in this
    terminal (alternate screen, hidden cursor, mouse, bracketed paste) are switched off.
    --read-only     Watch only: keys are not sent and the pane is never resized.
    With redirected input the bytes are sent as they are and the end of input detaches; a
    read-only attach reads no redirected input. With redirected output, nothing is restored or
    switched off, because nothing was changed.

HOTKEYS (docs/SUBAK_CLI.md §3.12, docs/HOTKEY_CONTRACT.md):
    The window's keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+T new Terminal, Ctrl+W close Terminal, Ctrl+Tab /
    Ctrl+Shift+Tab next/previous tab, Ctrl+Shift+R rename, copy, paste, zoom, scroll) follow
    the Kim hotkey contract. Your changes live in %APPDATA%\\mouv\\subak\\hotkeys.json; an
    action you never changed keeps the current default. A broken or newer file is never
    rewritten implicitly: the window uses the defaults (safe mode) and changes are refused
    (`hotkeys_invalid`) until it is fixed or `reset --all --yes` replaces it (keeping a .bak).
    A conflicting change is refused (`hotkey_conflict`) and nothing is written; --replace takes
    the keys away from the other Subak action. Disable or rebind Ctrl+T/Ctrl+W to let programs
    receive them (the Ctrl+B prefix pass-through comes with Step 23). `check --all-tools` reads
    the other installed Kim tools' files only. These commands never contact a Host, open a
    window or register a hotkey; an open window applies a change when it regains focus.
    KIM_NO_HOTKEYS=1 (or subak-gui --no-hotkeys) starts the window with every shortcut off.

SETTINGS AND PROFILES (docs/SUBAK_CLI.md §3.13, docs/SUBAK_GUI.md §13):
    %APPDATA%\\mouv\\subak\\config.toml holds the window's appearance (theme, font, size, line
    height, padding, opacity, motion), mouse and keyboard choices (copy on select, smart
    Ctrl+C, right/middle click, word separators) and basic shell profiles ([[profiles]]: name,
    program, args, cwd, env, unset_env). Hand-edit it or use these commands; the window's
    settings menu writes the same keys. An invalid value falls back to its default alone and is
    named with its line (`config check`); a broken or newer file is never rewritten by an edit.
    `reset --all` and `import` keep a backup in backups\\ (the newest 5). Secrets do not belong
    in profiles: import refuses them (`secret_in_config`) and every value that looks secret is
    shown as ***. Nothing here contacts a Host or changes a running Terminal: the window applies
    changes when it gets the focus, and a profile is used only when a Terminal is created
    (`new --profile <name>`, Ctrl+T, the window's New Terminal menu).

HOST (Windows only; docs/contracts/IPC_PROTOCOL.md, docs/CONPTY_PROOF.md):
    host start    Start a detached per-user Host, unless one already serves the endpoint
                  (`host_already_running`). Starters take a per-endpoint lock, so several at
                  once give one Host. It gets your logon environment, not this terminal's.
                  With --shell (default %ComSpec%) it starts with one Terminal running that
                  command line; --no-shell starts it with none. The Host runs while it owns a
                  live Terminal or has a client, then exits after the idle grace period.
                  Closing this window or any client never ends it. `subak new` starts one on
                  demand, so this is rarely needed.
    host status   Host process id, protocol, job breakaway, environment, Terminals, clients.
    host health   Heartbeat: check that the endpoint is served by subak.exe of this user, do
                  the handshake and report the answer time. Exit 0 only when healthy.
    host attach   Same as `subak attach` without a target.
    host stop     Stop the Host. With live Terminals it refuses (`terminals_running`) unless
                  --kill-terminals is given, and then asks first, or needs --yes.
    host serve    Run the Host in this process (what `host start` launches detached).

    Every client checks, before sending anything, that the pipe is served by subak.exe of
    this user (`host_identity_mismatch` otherwise); the Host checks each client's token. A
    Host that does not answer is reported (`host_unresponsive`), never ended or replaced.
    The Host listens only on that local, same-user named pipe: no network listener.

OPTIONS:
    --endpoint <name>  Pipe name under \\\\.\\pipe\\ (default: mouv-subak-<user SID>-s<session>).
                       Use your own name for experiments; it never touches the default Host.
    --shell <command>  Command line of the Host's first Terminal (host start/serve).
    --no-shell         Start a Host that owns no Terminal (host start/serve).
    --idle-exit <s>    Seconds the Host waits with no live Terminal and no client before it
                       exits (0..86400, default 10).
    --size <c>x<r>     Pseudo console size (new, attach; 2..1000 each).
    --cwd <dir>        Working directory of a new Terminal (an absolute path).
    --env NAME=VALUE   Set a variable in a new Terminal (repeatable). --env NAME copies this
                       terminal's value, so a token never appears on a command line.
    --unset-env NAME   Remove a variable from a new Terminal's environment (repeatable).
    --command-line <l> A verbatim command line for a new Terminal (instead of -- <program>).
    --remain-on-exit   Keep a new Terminal as `stopped` when its program exits by itself.
    --keep-on-failure  Keep a Terminal whose program could not start, as `failed`.
    --history-limit <n> new: history rows the Host keeps for the pane (0..100000, default 2000).
    --profile <name>   new: start a profile of config.toml (its program, args, cwd and env;
                       -- <program>, --command-line, --cwd and --env given here win). Without
                       a program, new uses terminal.default_profile unless --no-profile.
    --start/--end <l>  capture: first/last line (a number, negative for history, or -).
    --history          capture: from the oldest history line.
    --vt / --join      capture: keep escape sequences / join wrapped rows.
    --no-redact        capture: show secret-looking values instead of ***.
    --no-start         new: never start a Host; fail with `host_not_running` instead.
    --attach           new: attach to the new Terminal at once.

    --dry-run          Show what would happen; change nothing.
    -y, --yes          Confirm a destructive command without asking.
    --json             One JSON document on stdout (docs/CLI_CONTRACT.md §7).

    -q, --quiet / -v, --verbose   Less / more diagnostics on stderr.

The window is a separate program, `subak-gui` (docs/SUBAK_GUI.md); no command here starts it.
Pre-alpha: no windows/panes splits, persistence or recovery yet (docs/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md);
history is never persisted.
No command opens a window, installs anything or uses the network; no Windows service exists.

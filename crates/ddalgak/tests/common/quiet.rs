//! Real-input attempts on a desktop that a person uses at the same time (Step 75).
//!
//! The real-input tests inject obscure keys (F13–F20) with `SendInput` while the maintainer keeps
//! working on the same PC. Physical input can legitimately change what the engine does during an
//! attempt:
//!
//! - a **held modifier** (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Win) makes an exact trigger such as `F13` not match
//!   (DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL §3.2), so the rule under test never fires;
//! - **any key going down** decides an undecided dual role at once (§5.1), so a hold resolves
//!   before its tap time or a tap becomes a hold.
//!
//! An attempt is therefore judged together with the physical input the engine's own hook saw
//! during it (`Stats::physical`, non-injected events: `LLKHF_INJECTED` clear) and the modifiers
//! held around it. A failed attempt with physical input is **disturbed**: reported, cleaned up and
//! retried (at most [`ATTEMPTS`] times). A failed attempt without physical input is a real failure
//! and panics, so real bugs are never hidden. When every attempt was disturbed the step is
//! reported as **skipped (disturbed)**, never as verified.

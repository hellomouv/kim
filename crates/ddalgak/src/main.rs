//! `ddalgak` — Ddalgak's headless CLI (docs/DDALGAK_ENGINE.md §6, docs/CLI_CONTRACT.md).
//!
//! Pre-alpha: engine status and health, turning the engine on, pausing, resuming and turning it
//! off in the running tray app (`ddalgak-gui.exe`) over an identity-checked local pipe, ending the
//! app, opt-in start at sign-in (Step 66), and managing rules — list, show, check, add, edit,
//! delete, duplicate, enable, disable, move, revoke consent, drafts, history, backup and restore
//! (Step 67, `rule_cmd`), and modes — list, show, add, edit, rename, copy, delete, and set,
//! toggle, reset and status of the running engine's mode (Step 72, `mode_cmd`), and profiles —
//! list, show, add, edit, rename, duplicate, delete, apply (the switch), save points, history,
//! restore, rollback, export and import (Step 75, `profile_cmd`). The CLI
//! **never** starts the app, installs a hook, opens a window or
//! shows a tray icon (`DDALGAK-FR-060`, `DDALGAK-SEC-010`); with no app running, commands that
//! need it fail with `engine_not_running`, and rule changes are simply saved.

COMMANDS:
    status        Engine state (off, running, paused) and why it is off, the rules summary
                  (active rule IDs; inactive rules with their codes), Ddalgak's own global
                  shortcuts, recent activity (rule IDs and outcome codes only, never keys) and
                  start at sign-in. Works without the app (it then reads the files).
    health        Ask the running app: is its keyboard hook thread alive, how long do hook
                  callbacks take, were signals dropped, how often did its threads wake up and
                  how much CPU has it used. On demand only; nothing runs on a timer. Problems
                  are listed in `data.healthy` and `data.problems`. Ddalgak never reinstalls a
                  hook by itself.
    engine start  Turn the engine on in the running app (alias: engine on). Reads rules.json
                  again; an invalid file keeps it off (`rules_invalid`). Refused while the app
                  runs as administrator (`engine_elevated`).
    engine pause  Pause rules; engine-control rules keep working; held keys and buttons
                  (remap targets, held mouse buttons) are released and pointer moves stop.
    engine resume Resume a paused engine. Never turns an engine on that is off.
    engine stop   Turn the engine off (alias: engine off): the keyboard hook (and the mouse
                  hook, which exists only while a mouse-button rule does) is removed.
    enable        Turn the engine on in the running app (like engine start). With a scope,
                  switch rules (--rule <id>..., --allow gives consent), a mode (--mode <id>:
                  its own rules stop and nothing switches to it; never the default mode) or a
                  whole profile (--profile <id>: none of its rules run) on in rules.json; that
                  works without the app and a running app reloads at once.
    disable       Turn the engine off (like engine stop). Your turn-off is remembered: a
                  restart, sign-out or reboot keeps the engine off, even with engine_on_start:
                  on, until you turn it on again. With a scope, switch it off in rules.json;
                  nothing ever turns a disabled profile, mode or rule back on by itself.
    release       Release every key and button Ddalgak holds, make the engine forget its key
                  state, and release keys Windows still considers pressed although nobody holds
                  them (a modifier you are pressing is left alone while the engine is on). For
                  a key that acts stuck; the tray menu has the same item.
    quit          End the tray app (the engine is turned off first).
    startup ...   Opt-in start of the tray app when you sign in, as one value under
                  HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. No service, no task.

RULES (rules.json; these commands work without the app):
    rule list     Every rule with its trigger and state: active, disabled, inactive (with a
                  code), other_mode or other_profile. rule show prints one rule in full; the
                  text of a type_text step only with --show-text (otherwise its counts), launch
                  targets only with --show-targets (otherwise the program's file name, the
                  number of arguments, the website's scheme and host, the variable names).
    rule check    Validate everything: the schema, IDs, mode and profile references, recursive
                  outputs, duplicate triggers, rules that can never fire (shadowed triggers,
                  hidden sequences), stale launch consent, collisions with Ddalgak's own
                  shortcuts, missing program files. Each problem comes with offers (another
                  free chord, disable, --allow, keep); offers are never applied by themselves.
    rule add      A new rule with a new ID (r-<uuid>, or --id), triggered by --trigger <keys>
                  or --hotstring <abbreviation>. Actions: --action engine --op
                  pause|resume|toggle_pause|disable; remap --to <key> [--tap <key>]; block;
                  send_keys --keys <seq> [--step-delay-ms <n>]; type_text --text <t>
                  [--escapes] [--variables] [--method paste] [--key-delay-ms <n>];
                  open_program --path <exe> | --app-id <id> [--arg <a>]... [--working-dir <d>]
                  [--window normal|maximized|minimized] [--if-running start_new|activate]
                  [--env NAME=VALUE]...; open_url --url <url>; mouse_move --dx <n> --dy <n>
                  [--grid <cols>x<rows>] [--speed <px/s> [--acceleration <0-10>] |
                  --repeat-ms <ms> [--delay-ms <ms>]] or --x <n> --y <n> [--relative-to
                  virtual_screen|primary_monitor|active_window]; mouse_scroll --direction
                  up|down|left|right [--notches <1-50>]; mouse_click --button
                  left|right|middle|x1|x2 [--op click|double_click|hold] [--x <n> --y <n>];
                  mode --op <op> [--target-mode <m>]...; delay --ms <n>; any step as
                  --step '<json>'.
                  Rule options: --title, --description, --on press|release|hold, --hold-ms,
                  --repeat, --pass-through, --accept-injected, --mode <m>..., --priority,
                  --on-error stop|continue, --times <1-100>, --schedule <json> instead of
                  --trigger (Step 79: every_minutes 1-1440, or at HH:MM with optional days). Every step type runs; several
                  --step values of different types, a delay or --times above 1 make a macro
                  (Step 78): the steps run in order, one macro at a time, cancelled by pause,
                  stop, reload or the emergency chord, at most a minute (remaps, blocks,
                  holds and moves while held stay a rule's only step).
    mouse         mouse_move moves the pointer by --dx/--dy logical pixels (scaled by the
                  monitor's display scale; with --grid, cells of a virtual grid, landing on
                  cell centres) or to --x/--y (desktop pixels, or relative to the primary
                  monitor or the active window's content area). Targets never leave the
                  visible desktop: a point beside every monitor lands on the nearest edge, a
                  move stops where its path leaves the desktop. While the trigger is held:
                  --speed glides (--acceleration speeds it up over the first second, at most
                  10000 px/s), --repeat-ms repeats the step after --delay-ms (default 300),
                  whatever the keyboard's repeat settings. mouse_scroll sends wheel notches;
                  mouse_click clicks, double-clicks or holds a button exactly as long as the
                  trigger (released on pause, stop, lock, the emergency chord and every other
                  way out). Positions are read only when a rule runs; mouse actions need no
                  mouse hook and never track the pointer. Nothing is sent to the secure
                  desktop or to an administrator window under the pointer. Examples (they
                  also need --allow input-injection):
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Right --action mouse_move
                      --dx 1 --dy 0 --speed 600 --acceleration 3
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger Ctrl+Alt+Shift+L --action mouse_move --dx 1
                      --grid 16x9 --repeat-ms 150
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Home --action mouse_move
                      --x 960 --y 540 --relative-to primary_monitor
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger Ctrl+Alt+Shift+PageDown --action mouse_scroll
                      --direction down --notches 3
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Space --action mouse_click
                      --button left --op hold
    launches      open_program starts exactly the .exe you name (an absolute path, or under
                  %ProgramFiles%, %ProgramFiles(x86)%, %LocalAppData%, %AppData%, %UserProfile%,
                  %SystemRoot%), as you, with each --arg quoted by Ddalgak: never a shell
                  string, never searched for, never elevated (a program that asks for
                  administrator rights ends with program_requires_elevation). cmd, PowerShell
                  and other script hosts are refused. --env sets a variable for that program
                  only. open_url hands an http or https address to your default browser
                  (https:// is added when missing); file:, javascript:, ms-settings: and other
                  protocols are refused, and so is a user name or password. A rule starts at
                  most once a second (rate_limited) and never twice at once (busy). Examples
                  (they also need --allow launch-programs):
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger Ctrl+Shift+F6 --action open_program
                      --path '%SystemRoot%\\System32\\notepad.exe'
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger Ctrl+Shift+F7 --action open_program
                      --app-id Microsoft.WindowsCalculator_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger Ctrl+Shift+F9 --action open_url --url github.com
    remaps        A key, chord or mouse button acts as another key, chord, modifier or mouse
                  button for exactly as long as it is held (keys: docs/HOTKEY_CONTRACT.md §5;
                  code:KeyJ is the key at that position on every layout; MouseLeft, MouseRight,
                  MouseMiddle, MouseX1, MouseX2; only the middle and X buttons are triggers).
                  A plain trigger keeps the held modifiers (Shift+CapsLock -> Shift+Escape) but
                  never takes a reserved chord (Alt+Tab, Win chords); a trigger with modifiers
                  releases them while its target is held. Outputs never trigger rules, so swaps
                  cannot loop. Examples (remaps also need --allow input-injection):
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger CapsLock --action remap --to LCtrl --tap Escape
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger RAlt --action remap --to HangulMode
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger Ctrl+Shift+J --action remap --to Down
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger MouseX1 --action remap --to Alt+Left
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger F14 --action remap --to F16 --pass-through
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger Insert --action block
    typing        type_text types its text exactly as written (Hangul, emoji, new lines, tabs)
                  as Unicode key events, or pastes it (--method paste: the clipboard is copied
                  first, restored after 500 ms, and the paste is refused when its content
                  cannot be copied). --escapes reads \\n, \\t, \\\\ and \\u{AC00} in --text.
                  --variables fills in {date}, {time}, {datetime}, {year}, {month}, {day},
                  {hour}, {minute}, {second} and {cursor} (where the cursor ends up); no
                  environment or clipboard variables. Typing stops when focus moves to another
                  window (focus_changed) and never types into password fields, elevated or
                  read-only windows; pause, stop and the emergency chord cancel it. The text
                  never appears in status, activity, messages or JSON output.
    hotstrings    --hotstring btw: typing the abbreviation and an end character (space, Tab,
                  Enter or one of - ( ) [ ] { } ' : ; \" / \\ , . ? !) erases it and types the
                  replacement. Options: --case conform|insensitive|sensitive, --inside-words,
                  --immediate (no end character), --end-chars <chars>, --omit-end,
                  --keep-abbreviation. Never in password fields, during an IME composition or
                  in Hangul mode; Ddalgak keeps only the last few characters (the longest
                  abbreviation plus one) and forgets them on every focus change. Examples
                  (they also need --allow input-injection):
                    ddalgak rule add --hotstring btw --action type_text --text 'by the way'
                    ddalgak rule add --hotstring ';dd' --immediate --action type_text
                      --text '{date}' --variables
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger Ctrl+Shift+F2 --action type_text --escapes
                      --text '감사합니다.\\n김민수 드림'
    rule edit     Change fields with the same options, or --patch '<json merge patch>'. IDs
                  never change. Changed launch targets need a fresh --allow launch-programs.
    rule delete   Remove rules (asks, or needs --yes). duplicate makes a disabled copy.
    enable, disable, move, revoke   Switch rules on or off, change their order (the last
                  precedence step), or withdraw a consent (the rule is then disabled).
    --allow <permission>   Your explicit consent: input-injection, launch-programs (bound to
                  the exact targets) or clipboard. Without it a new rule that needs one is
                  saved disabled (consent_required, exit 7). Agents never grant consent.

    Every change is validated first: one that would add an error (a trigger another rule
    already has, a reserved chord, a broken step) is refused and nothing is written
    (rule_conflict, hotkey_reserved, rule_invalid). An unusable file is never rewritten
    automatically. Writes are atomic (temporary file, flush, rename) under a lock, so two
    commands at once never lose a change; the previous file stays as rules.json.bak and every
    change as a snapshot in history\\ (the last 50).
    Write options: --dry-run (validate and show, write nothing), --draft (change
    rules.draft.json; `rules draft apply` saves it), --if-revision <n> (refuse with
    rule_conflict when the rules changed since you read revision n), --endpoint <name>.
    After a saved change a running app is asked to reload (it also notices file changes by
    itself): a valid file replaces the active rules at once, without a restart and without
    removing the hook; an invalid one leaves the active rules as they were. status shows the
    saved, active and draft revisions apart.
    rules history | backup | restore   The snapshots; a snapshot now; bring back rules.json.bak
                  or a snapshot as a new revision (asks, or needs --yes).

MODES (Step 72):
    A mode is a named state of a profile; rules limited to it (--mode <m> on rule add) work only
    while it is active, rules without modes work in every mode. A mode with --parent is a layer:
    keys it does not change keep the parent's rules (and the parent's parent's); without a
    parent it is exclusive. Exactly one mode is active; the engine starts in the default mode
    and never restores another one after a restart, a pause or the emergency chord.
    mode list/show  The modes with their policy (exclusive or layer), chain, exits, rules, the
                  rules that switch to them, problems and, with a running engine, the active one.
    mode add      --title <name> [--id <id>] [--icon <badge>] [--color #rrggbb] [--parent <m>]
                  [--one-shot] (ends after the next key) [--timeout-ms <1000-3600000>] (the
                  default mode returns after that long without a key) [--default].
    mode edit     The same options, --no-… to clear one. IDs never change; rename changes the
                  title. copy duplicates the mode and the rules limited to it (fresh IDs).
    mode delete   Refused for the default mode, a mode other modes are layers over, and a mode
                  a rule switches to (mode_in_use); rules limited to it are kept unless
                  --delete-rules. Deleting the active mode returns the engine to the default.
    mode set | toggle | reset   Change the running engine's mode (engine_off when it is off;
                  never starts the app). Every change of the active mode releases held keys and
                  buttons. reset is the safe way back to the default mode.
    mode status   The active mode, held layers, the precedence chain and since when.
    Mode rules: --action mode --op set|toggle|hold|previous|default [--target-mode <m>] or
                  --op cycle --target-mode <a> --target-mode <b>...; hold is a layer while the
                  key is held. They inject nothing and need no consent. Examples:
                    ddalgak mode add --id nav --title Navigation --parent base --icon N
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger CapsLock --action mode --op hold
                      --target-mode nav
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger code:KeyH --mode nav --action remap --to Left
                      --allow input-injection
                    ddalgak rule add --trigger Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F13 --action mode --op toggle
                      --target-mode nav

PROFILES (Step 75):
    A profile is a complete set of modes and rules (work, gaming, development); exactly one is
    active and it stays active across restarts until you switch. Nothing else ever switches
    it: not a restart, a crash, an import or a reload.
    profile list  Every profile with its rules (on/total), modes and errors; --search matches
                  the ID, name and description, --sort order|title|id|rules.
    profile show  Its modes, its rules (titles, triggers and step kinds only), how many saved
                  versions it has and, when it is not active, what a switch would change.
    profile add | edit | rename | duplicate | delete   Friendly names and descriptions;
                  duplicate copies every mode and rule (rules get new IDs); delete is refused
                  for the active and the only profile (profile_in_use).
    profile apply Switch: --dry-run previews what each trigger does before and after. A
                  running app switches atomically: the old profile's runs end, every key and
                  button it holds is released, keys pressed during the switch keep their pairs,
                  and the new profile starts in its default mode. `switched` says the app
                  confirmed it.
    profile save  A save point (in savepoints, labelled, kept apart from the automatic history).
    profile history | restore | rollback   Versions of one profile from the history and its
                  save points; rollback goes back to the newest earlier version that had no
                  error. Both show a side-by-side diff, ask first (--yes) and are new changes
                  themselves, so they can be undone the same way.
    profile export  A portable file (ddalgak.rules with an `exported` block): every rule off,
                  no consent, settings or revision, paths under known folders as tokens
                  (%LocalAppData%\\...), environment values left out unless
                  --include-env-values.
    profile import  Validates (a corrupt or newer file is refused), shows what would be added
                  (--dry-run): renamed IDs, modes the file lacked, rules that need consent,
                  missing programs, duplicate triggers and Ddalgak's own shortcuts. It adds the
                  profiles NOT active, with every rule off and without consent, and never
                  opens, types or runs anything. Targets are shown only with --show-targets.

    The CLI never starts the app: start ddalgak-gui.exe yourself (it shows a tray icon). Every
    command checks, before sending anything, that the pipe is served by ddalgak-gui.exe of this
    user (`app_identity_mismatch` otherwise). The emergency chord Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Escape always
    turns the engine off from the keyboard, whatever the rules say: it is checked on the
    physical keys before any rule, also with conflicting remaps or a broken rules.json.

RECOVERY (Step 73):
    After a crash or a killed app the engine starts off and releases keys Windows still
    considers pressed. A session lock releases held keys and rules wait until you unlock; the
    engine state does not change. A hook callback that takes as long as Windows'
    LowLevelHooksTimeout (Windows may then remove the hook silently) turns the engine off with
    hook_lost; turn it on again for a fresh hook. A shortcut another program owns stays
    `taken` (status, health) and is never taken from it.

OPTIONS:
    --endpoint <name>  Pipe name under \\\\.\\pipe\\ (default: mouv-ddalgak-<user SID>-s<session>).
    --dry-run          Show what would happen; change nothing.
    --json             One JSON document on stdout (docs/CLI_CONTRACT.md §7).
    --yes, -y          Confirm a destructive change when ddalgak cannot ask.
    --no-input         Never ask (also KIM_NO_INPUT=1).
    -q, --quiet / -v, --verbose   Less / more diagnostics on stderr.

FILES:
    %APPDATA%\\mouv\\ddalgak\\rules.json     rules (ddalgak.rules v1), with rules.json.bak, history\\,
                                         savepoints\\, rules.draft.json and the writers' lock
                                         rules.json.lock
    %APPDATA%\\mouv\\ddalgak\\hotkeys.json   Ddalgak's own shortcuts (engine.toggle, engine.pause)
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\\mouv\\ddalgak\\          crash, emergency and turned-off markers

Pre-alpha: rules can control the engine (pause, resume, turn off), remap keys and mouse buttons,
block keys, send key sequences, type text, open programs and websites, and move, scroll and
click the mouse, and switch user-defined modes and layers. Linux is not supported yet. No
command opens a window, installs anything or uses the network.

//! The worker thread: everything that happens after the hook decided (ADR 0024 §3).
//!
//! The hook callback only pushes a small [`Signal`] into a bounded queue (`try_send`; a full
//! queue drops the signal and counts it, it never blocks the callback). The worker runs the
//! fired rules' steps, times `hold` triggers, and records outcomes in the [`Activity`] list.
//! It sleeps in a blocking receive; a timeout exists only while a hold trigger is down, so an
//! idle engine has no timer (`DDALGAK-NFR-001`).
//!
//! Engine-control steps are handed to the controller (the host's main thread), which owns the
//! lifecycle; the worker never changes the engine state itself.
//!
//! **Output** (Step 68): the worker owns the [`Injector`] and its ledger. It carries out the
//! core's remap instructions ([`RemapOp`]) exactly as given, sends on keys the core held back
//! ([`Signal::Replay`]) and releases everything it holds on [`Msg::Cancel`] (pause, stop, session
//! lock, profile switch), on [`Signal::ReleaseAll`] (sent by the hook thread after it dropped its
//! remaps, so it is ordered after every press the hook decided before), on the emergency chord and
//! when it stops (`Drop`). Remap instructions carry their output keys, so a held output is released
//! correctly even after a reload changed the rules; only the activity entry needs the current
//! rules. A repeat is sent only for an output the ledger still holds, so a late repeat can never
//! press again what a release-all let go.
//!
//! **Launches** (Step 70, [`crate::launch`]): a fired `open_program`/`open_url` rule passes a gate
//! (`busy` while its previous run is still going, `rate_limited` within a second of its last
//! start) and runs on a short-lived `ddalgak-launch` thread, so a slow shell hand-off never delays
//! remaps or typing; a cancellation ends it before its next target. No launch thread exists while
//! nothing launches.
//!
//! **Typing runs** (Step 69, [`crate::run`]): `type_text` and `send_keys` rules and hotstrings run
//! one at a time as a plan of pieces, carried out between the worker's other messages (one
//! `SendInput` call per piece, waits as timeouts), so remaps keep working while text is typed.
//! A trigger while a run is in progress is dropped with `busy` (a hotstring's consumed key is
//! given back). Pause, stop, session lock, a reload, the emergency chord and the worker's end
//! cancel the run at its next piece (`cancelled`), after restoring the clipboard and the
//! modifiers. A run has a timeout only while it waits, so an idle engine still has no timer.
//!
//! **Mouse actions** (Step 71, [`crate::mouse`]): a fired rule of mouse steps runs at once (one
//! `SendInput` call per step, each target checked first: the secure desktop and an elevated
//! window at the point step aside). A held button is a remap instruction like any other; when the
//! rule names a point, the pointer moves there in the same call as the button's down. A move
//! while held starts a motion that the worker ticks every [`mouse::TICK_MS`] (continuous) or at
//! its repeat times (stepped) until [`Signal::MotionEnd`]; the timer exists only while a motion
//! does. Pause, stop, session lock, a reload, a release-all, the emergency chord and the worker's
//! end stop every motion (`cancelled`), and a motion held longer than [`mouse::MAX_HOLD_MS`] ends
//! with `timeout`, so a lost trigger-up can never keep the pointer moving.

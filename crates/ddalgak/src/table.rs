//! Compiled trigger tables (DDALGAK_SAFETY §7: "decides synchronously only whether the event is
//! consumed, using precomputed trigger tables").
//!
//! A [`Binding`] is what the engine needs from one active rule: its trigger with `on`, `repeat`,
//! `pass_through` and the injected-input policy, whether it is an engine-control rule (which keeps
//! working while paused), whether it injects input (skipped over elevated windows) and, for a
//! remap (Step 68), its compiled outputs. Bindings are given in precedence order
//! (DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL §7.1; the loader sorts them). [`Table::compile`] turns them into
//! fixed-size records with virtual keys and scan codes, so the hook callback compares numbers and
//! never allocates.

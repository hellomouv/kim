//! Typing runs: `type_text`, `send_keys` and hotstring replacements (docs/DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL.md
//! §5.3, §5.4, §3.4; `DDALGAK-FR-011`, `DDALGAK-FR-012`, `DDALGAK-FR-070`, `DDALGAK-SEC-002`,
//! `DDALGAK-SEC-005`, `DDALGAK-SEC-007`, `DDALGAK-SEC-011`; ADR 0034).
//!
//! A run is a small plan of [`Piece`]s that the worker carries out one at a time, between its
//! other messages, so remaps keep working while text is typed and a pause, a stop, the emergency
//! chord or a reload ends the run at the next piece (`cancelled`). Before the first piece the
//! worker asks the platform about the focused target ([`Probe`]); before **every** call that
//! sends keys it asks again and stops when
//!
//! | The target | Outcome |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | the session is locked or the secure desktop is shown | `skipped_secure_desktop` |
//! | is a password field (`ES_PASSWORD`) | `skipped_password_field` |
//! | belongs to a process with a higher integrity level (UIPI would drop the input silently) | `skipped_elevated_target` |
//! | has an IME composition (or, for hotstrings, the IME is in native mode such as Hangul) | `skipped_ime_composition` |
//! | no control has keyboard focus, or it is disabled or read-only | `skipped_disabled_field` |
//! | another window or control took focus since the run started | `focus_changed`: nothing more is typed, never into the new window |
//! | `SendInput` inserted fewer events than asked | `injection_failed` |
//!
//! **Modifiers.** Before typing, the modifiers the application sees held (the trigger's
//! `Ctrl+Shift`, the Shift of an end character `!`) are released logically, with a masking key
//! before an Alt is released so no menu bar opens; afterwards Ctrl and Shift are pressed again if
//! they are still physically held (or held by a remap). Alt and Win are not pressed again: a lone
//! Alt release would open the menu bar; the core consumes their physical release instead
//! ([`RunShared::lifted`]).
//!
//! **Paste** (`method: paste`): the clipboard is opened (retried for up to 200 ms; then
//! `clipboard_busy`), every format on it is copied ([`Clipboard::snapshot`]; a format that cannot
//! be copied faithfully refuses the paste with `clipboard_not_restorable` and leaves the clipboard
//! untouched), the text is put on it (excluded from the clipboard history and cloud clipboard),
//! Ctrl+V is pressed, and after [`PASTE_SETTLE_MS`] the copy is put back, unless another program
//! changed the clipboard meanwhile (its newer content wins). A restore that cannot open the
//! clipboard within 500 ms ends with `clipboard_restore_failed` (the snippet stays on it). Every
//! way out of a run (cancel, emergency, focus change, failure) restores the clipboard first.
//!
//! **Hotstrings.** The key that completed the abbreviation was consumed by the core; the run
//! erases the abbreviation with Backspace, types the replacement and types the end character
//! again (the same key with the same modifiers), unless the rule omits it. When nothing is typed
//! (busy, a skip, a reload), the consumed key is given back unchanged. When the user typed
//! another key between the trigger and the first Backspace, the run is `cancelled` without
//! erasing anything, so it never deletes what the user typed meanwhile.
//!
//! Runs record only the rule ID and the outcome; the text never leaves the plan.

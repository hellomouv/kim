//! The engine core: one decision per key event (DDALGAK_RULE_MODEL §7.1, ADR 0024 §3).
//!
//! [`Core::decide`] runs inside the low-level hook callback. It is synchronous, allocation-free
//! and bounded by the table size, and it only decides two things: whether the event is consumed
//! and which [`Signal`]s (at most two) the worker thread gets. Running steps never happens here.
//!
//! Pipeline for one event:
//!
//! 1. **Emergency chord** on *physical* key state, before anything else (`DDALGAK-SEC-003`). The
//!    event passes on; the engine trips and lets everything through until the hook is removed.
//! 2. **Own input** (`LLKHF_INJECTED` plus Ddalgak's marker) passes untouched and is never
//!    matched, so remaps that point at each other are swaps, not loops (`DDALGAK-SEC-004`).
//! 3. **Consumed down, consumed up**: a key-up (and auto-repeat) is consumed exactly when its
//!    key-down was, so applications never see half a key press (`DDALGAK-SEC-005`).
//! 4. **Candidates** in precedence order; other programs' injected input only reaches rules with
//!    `injected: accept`; while paused only engine-control rules remain. An exact chord beats a
//!    widened remap or block (a plain-key trigger that matches with modifiers held).
//! 5. **Stepping aside**: secure desktop or session lock, a password field, an IME composition,
//!    or (for injecting rules) an elevated foreground window skip the rule and let the key pass
//!    (`skipped_*`, `DDALGAK-SEC-002`, `DDALGAK-NFR-006`).
//! 6. **Rate limit** per rule (`max_runs_per_second`), which also stops storms of auto-repeat or
//!    of another program's injected input (`rate_limited`).
//!
//! **Remaps** (Step 68, §5.1) keep a small fixed table of active *slots*, one per held trigger.
//! The core decides every output event from its key state and hands the worker self-contained
//! instructions ([`RemapOp`]): which of the trigger's modifiers to release logically while the
//! target is held (and restore afterwards if still held), which target modifiers and which target
//! key to press, with reference counts so two remaps holding the same output never release it
//! early and a key the user already holds is never pressed or released by Ddalgak. A dual-role
//! remap (`tap`) stays undecided until another key goes down (the target is pressed first and
//! that key is sent after it, unchanged), its time passes (a one-shot timer of the hook thread,
//! [`Core::tick`]) or the trigger goes up (the tap output is sent). Instructions carry the output
//! keys, not rule indexes, so a held output is still released correctly after a reload.
//!
//! **Hotstrings** (Step 69, §3.4): while a hotstring rule is active, every key that reaches the
//! application unchanged is translated by the platform ([`Translate`]) and fed into a bounded
//! buffer ([`hotstring::Buffer`], the longest abbreviation plus one character), which every reset
//! clears. The key that completes an abbreviation is consumed (and given back by the worker when
//! nothing is typed) and the worker gets [`Signal::Hotstring`]. For typing runs the core also
//! publishes the modifier state the application sees and a count of physical key presses
//! ([`RunShared`]), and consumes the physical release of a modifier a run released logically.
//!
//! **Mouse holds** (Step 71, §5.7, §5.9): a held button (`mouse_click` with `op: hold`) is a remap
//! slot whose target is the button, so it shares the reference counts and every release path. A
//! move while held (`while_held`) fires on its trigger's down and keeps a small record of the
//! trigger key; the trigger's up sends [`Signal::MotionEnd`], and every path that releases the
//! remaps (pause, stop, session lock, a desktop switch, an elevated window taking focus, a key
//! reset) also ends every motion ([`Signal::ReleaseAll`]). A reload drops the records: the worker
//! stops every motion when it gets new rules.
//!
//! The core keeps only what matching needs (keys down, one pending tap, hold or sequence step,
//! the active remaps and motions, the bounded hotstring buffer). It records no keys
//! (`DDALGAK-SEC-001`).

//! Annotation: shapes, freehand strokes and text labels as editable vector objects (Step 56;
//! NOEUL-FR-080, NOEUL-FR-081, NOEUL-FR-083, NOEUL-NFR-014; NOEUL_UX_SPEC §4.9; ADR 0038).
//!
//! Everything here is platform-independent and runs headless:
//!
//! - **The model.** An annotation is an [`Object`]: a [`Shape`] (rectangle, ellipse, line, arrow,
//!   pen stroke, marker stroke or text label), a colour from the [`PALETTE`], a width level
//!   ([`WIDTHS`]) and the DPI of the monitor it was drawn on, so its strokes are as thick in device
//!   pixels as they looked on that monitor. Coordinates are device pixels of the picture it
//!   annotates (the frozen picture in the overlay, the pin's image on a pin), never screen points
//!   of a window that may move. Objects stay vectors until an output needs pixels
//!   ([`flatten`]: copy, save, a new pin's window); nothing is painted into the picture before.
//! - **Undo.** A [`Doc`] keeps the objects in drawing order (the last is on top) and every edit
//!   as one undo step — a whole stroke, a whole move, a whole text label typed — with redo until
//!   the next edit (NOEUL-FR-081). "Clear all" is an ordinary step. Undo and redo restore the
//!   exact objects, so they are lossless by construction.
//! - **Editing.** [`Editor`] turns presses, drags, keys, characters and input-method events into
//!   edits: draw with the current [`Tool`], select an object by pressing on it (the pen and the
//!   marker always draw; the text tool edits the label it presses on), move it, resize it by its
//!   handles, reorder, recolour, re-width or delete it, type and compose text (Korean IME
//!   compositions are shown inline and become text only when committed), and draw with the
//!   keyboard (`selection.mark` sets the points). It records which pixels changed
//!   ([`Editor::take_dirty`]) so the overlay redraws only those.
//! - **Pixels.** [`draw`] rasterizes objects into a BGRA buffer: anti-aliased strokes (round
//!   caps and joins), crisp axis-aligned rectangles, arrow heads, a marker's single translucent
//!   coverage (no darker overlaps), and text from the coverage mask a [`Typesetter`] produced
//!   (GDI with per-character font fallback on Windows, `win::typeset`; [`BlockType`] in tests).
//!   Alpha is straight, and source-over keeps the picture's transparency where nothing is drawn.
//!   The overlay shows exactly what [`flatten`] exports: both run [`draw`] over the same pixels.
//! - **Privacy tools** (Step 57; NOEUL-FR-082; ADR 0041). Mosaic, blur, the eraser and the solid
//!   redaction are objects too ([`Shape::Effect`]): a box dragged corner to corner, or a brush
//!   stroke (`Ctrl` switches the form). Their pixels ([`effects`]) are made from the picture at
//!   output time, in drawing order, and **every solid redaction is applied to the picture before
//!   anything else is drawn**: no blur, mosaic or eraser ever reads a pixel a redaction covers, and
//!   an output holds the opaque fill there and nothing else. Mosaic and blur are visual only (weak
//!   protection; the overlay says so); the original stays in memory under every effect until an
//!   output, so undo, delete or cancel restore it — only the user, only before export.

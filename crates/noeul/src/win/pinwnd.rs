//! Win32 pin windows: borderless, always-on-top, layered tool windows (NOEUL-FR-060,
//! NOEUL-FR-061, NOEUL-FR-062, NOEUL-FR-063, NOEUL-FR-026; ADR 0023 §2, ADR 0029, ADR 0044).
//!
//! - **Never on the taskbar or in Alt+Tab** (`WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW`, no `WS_EX_APPWINDOW`).
//! - **Retained picture.** The window's surface is painted once per change
//!   ([`transform::paint`]: the picture scaled to its rectangle — at 100 % one image pixel per
//!   device pixel — inside a one-pixel outline and the soft pin shadow, plus the click-through
//!   badge) into a temporary premultiplied DIB section and handed to `UpdateLayeredWindow`, which
//!   keeps its own copy; the DIB is freed at once. Opacity is the constant alpha of the same call
//!   with no new surface (nothing is painted again). No `WM_PAINT`, no timer, no GPU context: an
//!   idle or hidden pin costs no CPU (NOEUL-NFR-001, NOEUL-NFR-007), and its memory is measured
//!   in ADR 0029 (NOEUL-NFR-002).
//! - **Focus only when the user asks.** Created with `SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE` unless the user made it
//!   (then it takes focus so `Esc` and the arrows work at once); a click activates it. Hiding or
//!   closing the focused pin first hands focus back to the window the user was in before the
//!   pin took it (never to another pin), so the next key reaches that program, not a pin.
//!   Showing, moving, zooming and transforming never activate anything. A window created for the
//!   debug-build test hook ([`Style::OFF_SCREEN_TEST`]) is never topmost and can never be
//!   activated.
//! - **Z-order.** A new pin, and a pin shown again, go to the top of the topmost band once;
//!   pins never fight other topmost windows for it (no timer, no re-assertion). The capture
//!   overlay, created later, lies above them.
//! - **Input stays Noeul's own**: keys reach the pin only while it has focus; they are matched
//!   against the `pin` context and never forwarded anywhere (NOEUL-SEC-012). The IME is switched
//!   off for the window so letter shortcuts work in Hangul mode (NOEUL-NFR-014).
//! - **Mouse.** Dragging the picture moves it (the system move loop, `HTCAPTION`); dragging its
//!   outline, shadow or the band just inside its edge resizes it with the aspect ratio kept (the
//!   window's own capture and mouse messages, no system sizing loop); the wheel zooms around the
//!   pointer, `Ctrl`+wheel changes the opacity; a middle-click returns to 100 % and opaque; a
//!   right-click (or `Shift+F10`, or the menu key) opens its context menu; `Shift`+double-click
//!   toggles thumbnail mode; dropping it with `Ctrl` held onto another pin joins that pin's group.
//!   A plain double-click does nothing (NOEUL-FR-026). For the guard time a new pin was given,
//!   every press on it is swallowed (UX spec §4.2 rule 10).
//! - **Click-through** (NOEUL-FR-063): `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT` on the layered window, so the system
//!   hit-tests through it to the window below; the pin keeps keyboard focus if it had it (its
//!   `Ctrl+Shift+T` turns it back) and shows the badge.
//! - **Displays.** The rectangle `WM_DPICHANGED` suggests is ignored: a pin keeps its pixel size
//!   on every monitor (NOEUL-FR-061, NOEUL-FR-091). The message itself is reported to the core
//!   ([`PinEvent::DpiChanged`], Step 58), which looks at the displays once they are quiet and
//!   redraws the pin's outline, shadow and resize band for its monitor's scale.
//!
//! The window procedure only queues [`PinEvent`]s and calls the registered waker; the instance
//! core handles them later, never re-entrantly. The context menu is shown by [`track_menu`],
//! which the runtime calls with the core released.

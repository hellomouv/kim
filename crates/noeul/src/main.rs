//! `noeul` — Noeul's CLI and resident instance (pre-alpha, Steps 49, 50 and 53; ADR 0023,
//! ADR 0026, ADR 0029).
//!
//! Follows docs/CLI_CONTRACT.md: results on stdout, diagnostics on stderr, exactly one JSON
//! document with `--json`, documented exit codes and registered error codes, `--dry-run` for every
//! state-changing command, no prompts when Noeul cannot ask. Headless commands (`status`,
//! `health`, `capabilities`, `version`, `config`, `hotkeys …`, `pin list`) never open a window,
//! a tray icon or a prompt, never register a hotkey and never start the instance
//! (NOEUL-FR-111). Only `start` and `run` start the instance, which owns the tray icon, the pins
//! and the global hotkeys; `capture`, `pin …` and `quit` ask it over the identity-checked local
//! pipe. Noeul makes no network connection (NOEUL-NFR-008).

While Noeul runs, F1 opens the region selection overlay: drag a rectangle, then double-click
inside it to pin it at once (also Enter, the toolbar's Pin button or a middle-click). Ctrl+C or
Copy copies it, Ctrl+S or Save saves it where you choose, Ctrl+Shift+S quick-saves it, Esc or
right-click outside cancels; `noeul capture --interactive` opens the same overlay. In the overlay
C copies the colour under the magnifier's crosshair as text and Shift+C switches between HEX, RGB
and HSL (`noeul config set color.hex_case lower`, `color.alpha on`); F3 then pins it as a swatch.
F3 pins what
the clipboard holds: an image, image files copied in Explorer (or one copied path), a colour value
(#RGB, #RRGGBB, rgb(...), hsl(...), three numbers) as a swatch, HTML or text as a card (Noeul's own
renderer: no script, nothing downloaded; images become placeholders); Ctrl+Shift+C copies a card's
text back, and the pin's menu offers 'Pin clipboard as' the other kinds. Content marked private
(password managers) is never pinned. Image files dropped on a pin are pinned too; `noeul pin
<file>` and `noeul pin --clipboard [--as text]` do the same from scripts. The double-click can copy,
save or do nothing instead
(`noeul config set gestures.double_click copy`), and `noeul config set gestures.preset snipaste`
switches to Snipaste-style gestures (double-click and Enter copy, Ctrl+T pins).
Annotate before you pin, copy or save: the toolbar's rectangle, ellipse, line, arrow, pen,
marker and text tools draw inside the selection (Ctrl+Z undoes, Ctrl+Y redoes, [ and ] or the
wheel change the width, Esc leaves the tool and keeps the drawing); a label takes Korean and
other input methods. Enter still pins, with the annotations.
Annotation also has mosaic, blur, an eraser and an irreversible solid redaction.
Pins float on top: drag to move, drag the border (or its shadow) to resize, wheel or Plus/Minus
to zoom, Ctrl+wheel or Ctrl+Plus/Ctrl+Minus for opacity (never below 10 %), 1/2 rotate right
and left, 3/4 flip, T or Shift+double-click for a thumbnail, Ctrl+Shift+T lets clicks pass
through (the tray's Make all pins clickable, a second `noeul start` or `noeul pin set --all
--click-through off` bring them back), 0 or middle-click for 100 % and opaque, H hides, Esc
closes, Shift+Esc destroys, Space edits the pin's annotations (Enter keeps them, Esc leaves the
pin as it was), right-click (or Shift+F10) opens the pin's menu. `noeul pin
list/hide/show/close/set` and `noeul pin group list/switch` reach them from scripts. Pins live in
memory only and do not survive a restart.
`noeul capture --monitor 2 --pin` and `noeul capture --window active --pin` capture a whole monitor
or the window that has the focus without the overlay (also the keys capture.monitor and
capture.window, which have no default key: `noeul hotkeys set capture.window Ctrl+Alt+F1`);
--pointer draws the mouse pointer in (`noeul config set capture.pointer on` for the keys and F1).
Every capture is in device pixels; the result also gives the logical size on its monitor, and
says so when it spans monitors of different scales, comes from an HDR monitor (converted to SDR
by Windows), or shows a window that protects itself from capture (it stays black or absent).
Not in this build (labeled planned): animated GIF pins (a pin of an animated GIF shows its first
frame and says so), settings window (61), capture to a file or the clipboard from the command
line (62).

Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 failure (I/O, permission) · 2 usage · 3 not found (not running, no pin)
            4 integrity (protocol, identity) · 5 incompatible or unsupported platform
            6 unavailable (no unlocked desktop, unresponsive, clipboard busy)
            7 conflict or confirmation needed · 8 cancelled
--json prints exactly one JSON document on stdout, also for errors. Agents: add --json and
--no-input; every state-changing command supports --dry-run. Contract: docs/CLI_CONTRACT.md";

//! What the capture overlay can detect under the pointer: windows and UI elements, as
//! rectangles only (NOEUL-FR-040, NOEUL-FR-043, NOEUL-SEC-004, NOEUL-SEC-007; NOEUL_UX_SPEC
//! §4.8; ADR 0035).
//!
//! **Privacy.** Detection reads geometry and a few flags, nothing else: a window's rectangle, its
//! visibility, whether it is minimized, cloaked, layered, click-through, its constant opacity and
//! its capture affinity; a UI element's bounding rectangle. It never reads a title, class name,
//! process name, element name, value, help text or any other text, and it stores nothing beyond
//! the open capture session (the [`Snapshot`] lives in the overlay and is dropped with it). The
//! types below cannot hold text: there is no field for it.
//!
//! **Windows.** When a capture starts, the platform lists the top-level windows of the desktop in
//! Z-order, topmost first, as [`WindowFacts`] — taken right after the frozen picture, so the list
//! matches what the picture shows. [`classify`] decides which of them detection offers:
//!
//! | Window | Detection | Why |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | hidden, minimized, cloaked (another virtual desktop), empty or outside the picture | skipped | not in the picture |
//! | layered and click-through (`WS_EX_LAYERED` + `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT`) | skipped | the pointer and the eye go through it |
//! | layered with a constant opacity of 0 | skipped | invisible |
//! | excluded from capture (`WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE`) | skipped | absent from the frozen picture: what lies below is what the user sees |
//! | protected (`WDA_MONITOR`) | **offered as protected**: not highlighted, a click does not select it, a note says Windows shows it black | the picture holds black where it is (NOEUL-SEC-004) |
//! | every other window, including other layered ones | offered | its extended frame bounds, clipped to the picture |
//!
//! [`Snapshot::window_at`] is the topmost offered window that contains a point. A protected window
//! still hides the windows below it, so the plain region selection is what remains there.
//!
//! **Elements.** After `detect.cycle` (`E`) the overlay asks for the UI element under the pointer
//! inside the window found there ([`ElementRequest`]); the platform answers off the UI thread
//! with an [`ElementAnswer`]. [`check_element`] accepts a rectangle only if it contains the point
//! and lies inside its window (after one DPI reinterpretation for providers that report logical
//! pixels under fractional scaling); anything else falls back to the window rectangle, and a
//! window that refused or did not answer in time is not asked again during that capture
//! ([`Fallback`]).

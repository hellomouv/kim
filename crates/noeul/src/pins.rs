//! The pin engine's model: pins, their IDs, geometry, visibility, transforms, groups and
//! lifecycle (NOEUL-FR-060…NOEUL-FR-065, NOEUL-FR-067, NOEUL-FR-068, NOEUL-FR-025, NOEUL-FR-026;
//! ADR 0023 §4, ADR 0029, ADR 0044).
//!
//! A pin is a floating window that owns one [`Frame`] (its picture at 100 %). The registry gives
//! every pin a stable ID (`pin-<n>`, never reused while the instance runs), keeps the windows
//! behind the narrow [`PinWindow`]/[`PinWindows`] traits (the Win32 implementation is
//! `win::pinwnd`; tests use [`fake`]), and enforces the lifecycle:
//!
//! ```text
//!   create ──► open (shown ⇄ hidden, moved, zoomed, transformed) ──close──► closed (reopen memory: the last one)
//!                │                                             │            ──reopen──► open (same id)
//!                └──destroy──► gone ◄──────────────────────────┘ (a newer close replaces it; quit clears it)
//! ```
//!
//! - **Independent.** Each pin has its own ID, position, zoom, transforms, visibility, group and
//!   lifetime; an operation on one never touches another's window.
//! - **Geometry.** The picture's rectangle holds the shown picture's top-left corner; its shown
//!   size is the picture's size turned by its orientation, at the pin's zoom ([`crate::zoom`]) or
//!   as a thumbnail. The window is larger by the outline and shadow around the picture
//!   ([`crate::transform::View`]); everything here is about the picture's rectangle.
//!   [`Placement::Exact`] keeps a capture at its place and pixel size (NOEUL-FR-020);
//!   [`Placement::At`] puts a paste at a point inside the work area of the monitor there and
//!   zooms a picture larger than that work area out until it fits, so a huge paste never covers
//!   every screen (NOEUL-SEC-013).
//! - **Transforms** (Step 54, ADR 0044): rotation by 90° and flips ([`Orientation`], turning
//!   around the pin's centre), opacity (10–100 %, a constant alpha that renders nothing again),
//!   zoom by keys, the wheel or by dragging the border ([`Pins::resize`], aspect ratio kept),
//!   thumbnail mode and click-through. Every one is reversible and per pin. The picture and its
//!   annotations are never changed by a transform: the window shows the annotations drawn on the
//!   picture, then turned ([`shown`]); copy and save output exactly that at 100 % and opaque.
//! - **Groups** (Step 54): every pin belongs to a named group (new pins to the current one); a
//!   group is switched to (its pins shown, the others hidden), shown, hidden or closed at once.
//! - **Display changes.** Pins keep their place when monitors change, even off-screen
//!   (NOEUL-FR-067): [`Pins::sync`] only follows where the system really put a window, and
//!   [`Pins::bring_on_screen`] moves a pin that no monitor shows into the nearest work area,
//!   on request.
//! - **Memory.** Closing destroys the window but keeps the picture so "Reopen closed pin" can bring
//!   it back with its transforms (default memory: the last pin, NOEUL-FR-065); destroying frees it
//!   for good. Closing the capture overlay never closes pins. Quitting releases every picture.
//!   Nothing is written to disk, so pins do not survive a restart (NOEUL-SEC-005; opt-in backup is
//!   NOEUL-FR-066, N4).
//! - **Annotations** (Step 56). A pin keeps its picture unchanged and its annotations as vector
//!   objects in image pixels ([`crate::annotation`]); its window shows them flattened, and copy and
//!   save output them flattened ([`Pins::rendered`]). Editing a pin ([`Pins::set_editing`],
//!   [`Pins::commit_edit`]) replaces the objects and may crop the picture; a cancelled edit changes
//!   nothing. Closing and reopening keeps them.
//! - **Cards and files** (Step 55): a pin may be a card made from text, HTML, a colour value or
//!   file names (`crate::card`), or an image file; to the engine it is a picture like any other
//!   (it moves, zooms, transforms, copies, saves, closes and reopens the same way). Its
//!   [`Content`] adds the card's text for `pin.copy-text` and the kinds the clipboard offered for
//!   "Pin clipboard as…"; `pin.list` reports only the kind.
//! - **Animated pictures** (NOEUL-FR-068): this build has no animated pins. A pin made from an
//!   animated GIF shows its first frame and says so ([`Pins::mark_animation`], `pin.list`), never
//!   silently.

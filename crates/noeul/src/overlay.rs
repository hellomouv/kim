//! The region-selection overlay's model: its state machine, geometry, DPI math and pixels
//! (NOEUL-FR-010…014, NOEUL-FR-042, NOEUL-FR-090, NOEUL-NFR-012; NOEUL_UX_SPEC §4; ADR 0026).
//!
//! Everything here is platform-independent and runs headless: [`Overlay`] is fed [`Input`]s in
//! virtual-desktop device pixels and answers with an [`Outcome`]; [`Overlay::scene`] says what
//! the overlay shows, [`dirty`] which pixels changed between two scenes, and [`compose`] writes
//! those pixels of a [`Scene`] over the frozen picture into a back buffer. The Win32 window
//! (`win::overlay`) only turns messages into inputs, draws the labels' text and copies the back
//! buffer to the screen; tests drive the same code with synthetic monitor layouts.
//!
//! States (UX spec §4.1; Step 50 the selection, Step 51 the outputs):
//!
//! ```text
//!   Hover ──left press──► Pressed ──moved beyond the drag threshold──► Dragging ──release──► Selected
//!     ▲                     │ (released in place: a click; nothing yet)                     │
//!     │                     ▼                                                               │
//!     └── right-click outside the selection ◄── Selected ──press inside/on a handle──► Pressed
//!                                                  ▲         ──beyond threshold──► Moving / Resizing
//!                                                  └──────────────── release ─────────────────┘
//!   Esc (any state), right-click without a selection, another program activated → Cancel
//!   With a confirmed selection: double-click or middle-click inside, Enter, the toolbar or the
//!   context menu → Output(Pin | Copy | Save | QuickSave, rect, via)
//! ```
//!
//! A press that waits (the pointer pauses with the button held) stays `Pressed` for as long as
//! it likes: the drag starts from the press point as soon as the pointer moves beyond the
//! user's drag threshold, whatever the pause. No timer exists (NOEUL-NFR-001).
//!
//! **The double-click gesture** (Step 51, UX spec §4.2 rules 1–5 and 13, NOEUL-FR-020/021/024).
//! Noeul counts presses itself from the raw button messages with the user's system values (the
//! window class has no `CS_DBLCLKS`): a left press P1 in the [interior](Zone::Interior) of the
//! confirmed selection, with no modifier, released before the pointer left the drag rectangle,
//! followed by a second plain left press P2 in the interior, at most the double-click time after
//! P1 and inside the double-click rectangle centered on P1. The output fires on P2's *press* (so
//! the pin appears at once) and does what the `[gestures] double_click` setting says (pin by
//! default). A single click inside a selection does nothing, so a click never has to wait to be
//! told apart from a double-click. A press on a handle, the border band, the toolbar or the size
//! chip, a press that became a drag, move or resize, a press outside, a press with `Ctrl`,
//! `Shift`, `Alt` or `Win`, and the release that ends a drag never count. The owner refreshes
//! the system values before every press ([`Overlay::set_system_values`]), so a change of the
//! Windows double-click speed applies from the next press.
//!
//! **The toolbar** (UX spec §3.1, §5): Pin (first, primary), Copy, Save, Cancel next to the
//! confirmed selection, below it, above it when there is no room, inside its bottom edge when it
//! fills the monitor, never over the size chip. A button runs on release over itself
//! (`Shift`+Save quick-saves). `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` move the keyboard focus between the canvas and
//! the buttons, the arrows between the buttons; while a button has focus the navigation keys go
//! to it first ([`Nav`]), so `Enter` on Copy copies (ADR 0021 §5); `Escape` there cancels, as
//! everywhere.
//!
//! **Smart selection and pixel precision** (Step 52, UX spec §4.8, ADR 0035, NOEUL-FR-040…043,
//! NOEUL-FR-050):
//!
//! - *Detection.* While nothing is selected and no button is held, the window under the pointer
//!   (or, after `detect.cycle` (`E`), the UI element; again, nothing) is shown undimmed with the
//!   selection's border, and a click without a drag — or `selection.mark` (`Space`) — selects it.
//!   The windows come from a [`Snapshot`] taken with the frozen picture; elements are asked for
//!   with [`Overlay::take_element_request`] and answered with [`Input::Element`]. A window that is
//!   protected from capture is never highlighted (a note says Windows shows it black); anything
//!   that cannot be detected leaves the plain region selection.
//! - *Keyboard pointer.* `pointer.move-*` (`W A S D`, physical keys) move the pointer one device
//!   pixel, also during a drag or a resize; the owner moves the real cursor along
//!   ([`Overlay::take_warp`]). While the pointer was last moved by the keyboard, detection and
//!   snapping pause, so a corner lands exactly where the keys put it. `selection.mark` sets the
//!   first corner at the pointer, then the opposite one (`Marking`).
//! - *Acceleration.* Held keys ([`Input::Repeat`]) move 1, then 2, 5 and 10 pixels per repeat
//!   ([`accel`]).
//! - *Snapping.* While dragging or resizing with the mouse, a moving edge within 6 logical pixels
//!   of a monitor edge or a detected window's edge snaps to it; `Alt` turns it off for that move.
//! - *Magnifier.* Near the pointer: [`MAG_CELLS`]² pixels of the frozen picture enlarged, a centre
//!   crosshair, the device-pixel position (and the logical one on a scaled monitor) and the
//!   pixel's colour as HEX and RGB ([`Scene::sample`]). `magnifier.toggle` (`M`) shows or hides it.
//! - *History.* `history.previous` / `history.next` (`Comma` / `Period`) step through the
//!   rectangles of earlier successful captures over the current picture (memory only).
//!
//! **The colour picker** (Step 59, UX spec §4.14, ADR 0053, NOEUL-FR-044): the magnifier's
//! readout writes the pixel under its crosshair as HEX and RGB (and HSL when that is the chosen
//! format) in the picker's [`crate::color::Style`], the chosen format marked with an accent bar.
//! `color.format-next` (`Shift+C`) chooses the next format; `color.copy` (`C`) asks the owner to
//! copy that pixel's text ([`Outcome::Color`]) — only while the magnifier is shown, so `C` never
//! copies a pixel nobody sees. With nothing selected the capture then ends; with a selection (or
//! annotations) it stays, so no work is lost. The pin editor has no picker.
//!
//! **Annotation** (Step 56, UX spec §4.9, ADR 0038, NOEUL-FR-080…083): the toolbar gains the
//! tools (rectangle, ellipse, line, arrow, pen, marker, text), the colour and width buttons, undo
//! and redo. While a tool is active (phase `annotating`) presses inside the selection draw, pick
//! or edit objects ([`crate::annotation::Editor`]) and never pin (a double-click on a label
//! selects a word); `Escape` leaves the tool and keeps the drawing; `Enter` and Pin still pin, with
//! the annotations. The overlay shows the annotated pixels its owner renders
//! ([`crate::annotation::draw`] over the frozen picture, the `layer` of [`compose`]) and asks for
//! the label's input method while one is edited. [`Mode::PinEdit`] runs the same model over a
//! pin's picture: the selection is the pin, resizing it crops, `Enter` or Done commits, `Escape`
//! cancels, and losing focus keeps the work.
//!
//! Lengths of Noeul's own drawing are *logical* pixels scaled by the DPI of the monitor they are
//! drawn on (handles 7, handle zones 9, border band 3, small-selection limit 27, toolbar 32
//! high, magnifier cells 8, snapping 6); every selection, readout and pin rectangle is in
//! *device* pixels (NOEUL-FR-090).

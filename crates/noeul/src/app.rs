//! The instance core (ADR 0023 §1): one state machine that owns the capture sessions, the pins
//! and the shortcuts, and answers every request on the instance's UI thread.
//!
//! Requests arrive from four separate sources, and none of them can reach the others' state
//! except through [`App`]: IPC from the CLI ([`App::request`]), global hotkeys and tray clicks
//! ([`App::action`], [`App::tray_command`]) and the pin windows' own events
//! ([`App::pin_event`]). Everything the core needs from the OS goes through [`Shell`] (pin
//! windows, the clipboard, the pointer, notices) and [`CaptureBackend`], so the whole lifecycle
//! runs headless in tests with fakes; `win::runtime` supplies the Win32 implementations.
//!
//! The core never captures on its own (NOEUL-SEC-001), reads the clipboard only for
//! `paste.float` (NOEUL-SEC-002), writes no picture to disk (NOEUL-SEC-005) and reports only IDs,
//! geometry and counts (NOEUL-SEC-008).
//!
//! **The capture overlay** (Step 50, ADR 0026): `capture.region` (`F1`, the tray's left click,
//! `noeul capture --interactive`) freezes every monitor into one frame, opens a capture session
//! with it and shows an [`OverlayWindow`] over the virtual desktop. The window reports
//! [`OverlayEvent`]s; the core feeds them to the [`Overlay`] model, redraws only what changed,
//! and on `capture.pin` hands the session's [`crate::selection::CaptureSelection`] to a new pin.
//! While an overlay is open, further capture requests do nothing (NOEUL-FR-013).
//!
//! **Outputs of the overlay** (Step 51, UX spec §4.2): the overlay model reports
//! `Output(Pin | Copy | Save | QuickSave, rect, via)` for a double-click or middle-click inside
//! the selection, a key, the toolbar or the selection's context menu. A pin goes through
//! [`App::pin_selection`] (no clipboard, no file; a pointer gesture guards the new pin for one
//! double-click time); a copy encodes PNG and `CF_DIBV5` in memory and hands them to
//! [`Shell::clipboard_write`]; a save asks the runtime for the save dialog ([`SaveRequest`],
//! shown with the core released) and writes only the file the user chose; a quick save writes a
//! new file in the quick-save folder. Every failure keeps the overlay and its selection with a
//! banner (NOEUL-FR-025); a clipboard that is busy or disabled never affects Pin.
//!
//! **The pin engine** (Step 53, ADR 0029): every pin, whatever made it, goes through
//! [`crate::pins::NewPin`]: the overlay's selection through [`App::pin_selection`] (the entry
//! point of Step 51's double-click, with no clipboard in between), a CLI region through
//! `capture`/`pin.create`, the clipboard through `paste.float`/`pin.create`. Pins are moved,
//! zoomed, hidden, shown, closed and destroyed independently from their keys, the mouse, their
//! context menu ([`PinMenu`], shown by the runtime with the core released), the tray and IPC
//! (`pin.list`, `pin.hide`, `pin.show`, `pin.close`, `pin.reopen`). A display change
//! ([`App::display_changed`]) keeps pins where they are and offers to bring the lost ones back.
//!
//! **Smart selection** (Step 52, ADR 0035): when a capture starts, right after the frozen picture
//! and before the overlay is shown, the core asks [`Shell::window_snapshot`] for the windows on
//! the desktop (rectangles and flags only, NOEUL-SEC-007) and hands them to the model with the
//! `[capture] detection` mode; with detection off nothing is listed until `E` turns it on. Element
//! lookups go to [`Shell::request_element`], which answers off the UI thread as an
//! [`OverlayEvent::Element`]; [`Shell::end_detection`] stops them when the overlay closes. Pointer
//! keys move the real cursor through [`OverlayWindow::warp_pointer`]. The rectangles of
//! successful captures stay in memory for `history.*` (never on disk, NOEUL-SEC-005).
//!
//! **Annotation** (Step 56, ADR 0038): the overlay model keeps the annotations as vector objects;
//! after every input the core re-renders the changed pixels of the annotated selection (a layer
//! over the frozen picture, [`crate::annotation::draw`]) and lets the window's typesetter lay out
//! edited labels. Copy, save and quick save output the selection flattened with its annotations
//! ([`crate::annotation::flatten`]); Pin hands the unchanged pixels and the objects to the new pin,
//! which keeps them editable. `pin.annotate` (`Space`, the pin menu) opens the same overlay model
//! over a pin's picture ([`overlay::Mode::PinEdit`]) in a layered window; Done or `Enter` commits the
//! annotations (and a crop) to the pin, Cancel or `Escape` leaves the pin as it was. One overlay
//! exists at a time: a capture or a pin edit.
//!
//! **The colour picker** (Step 59, ADR 0053): the overlay is opened with the picker's style
//! (`[color]` settings, and the format last chosen with `Shift+C` while this instance runs). On
//! `color.copy` the core reads the one pixel of the frozen picture under the magnifier's crosshair
//! and puts its text on the clipboard with [`Shell::clipboard_write_text`] — the only clipboard
//! access; nothing is read and nothing listens (NOEUL-SEC-002). Without a selection the capture
//! then ends (`captures.colors`); with one it stays with a banner. Status names the format, never
//! the colour (NOEUL-SEC-008). After every redraw the window's accessible name follows what the
//! overlay shows ([`Overlay::accessible_name`]).
